Particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere originates from either direct emission or physical and chemical transformation of gaseous pollutants . Atmospheric aerosols have potential effects on human health, radiation balance, climate, and visibility , . Air quality has become an increasing public health concern since a series of heavy pollutions of fine particulate matter (PM, particles 2.5 m in diameter) occurred in Beijing in 2011 winter. According to the WHO air quality guidelines and interim targets for particulate matter in developing countries, the 24hour concentration of PM and PM should be controlled below 150 and 75 g/m, respectively . US EPA set the safe PM and PM concentration at 50 and 35 g/m, respectively . With the increase in public awareness of the degradation of visibility or hazy weather, China released the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in 2012, taking 150 and 75 g/m as the 24-hour PM and PM limits in urban area, respectively, and 70 and 35 g/m as the annual PM and PM limits, respectively. Previous epidemiological research has shown that high levels of particulate pollution lead to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as respiratory symptoms . Smaller particles are deposited more easily in the lungs , and are thus more harmful to health than larger particles . The chemical composition of the particles is important for understanding atmospheric visibility , as well as the locations of deposition in the lung . Water-soluble ions are a key area of atmospheric environmental research . Water-soluble ions, such as NH, Na, K, Ca, Mg, SO, NO, F and Cl, are significant components of atmospheric particles , , which varies depending upon the particle source , .
