The concentration gradient of total water-soluble ions was in the order Shijiazhuang> Tianjin> Beijing. Spring had the highest concentrations. The total concentrations by mass for summer and winter were similar, and higher than those in autumn. The gradient of ion species across the North China region was NO, SO> NH> Cl> Ca, K, Na> Mg, F. NO, SO, NH, and Cl were the dominant ion species, contributing more than 90% and 86% of the concentration by mass of the total water-soluble ions in PM and PM, respectively. The size of the particulate matter was an important determinant of the ion composition. Over 50% of the water-soluble ions were present in PM, and 73.9%-94.9% in PM. Secondary ions, including NO, SO and NH, comprised 43.4% and 31.5% of the total average concentrations by mass. The [NO]/[SO] ratio indicated that the contribution of vehicle pollution increased with economic development. The anion/cation balance varied among sites and seasons, indicating that the source might be complex. The balance of secondary ions was likely influenced by the usage of agricultural fertilizer. The pollution patterns of the whole area were somewhat significantly correlated. Further studies of organic carbon and pollution source apportionment are needed.
