The outcome of interest was SC, defined as an absence of defect by 2-dimensional imaging and absence of flow across the ventricular septum, determined by pulsed or color Doppler echocardiography. Patients were followed up in 6-month or 1-year intervals until December 2009 (mean 20.915.0 months) in the derivation cohort and December 2012(mean 10.610.8 months) in the validation cohort, except in cases with just 1 echocardiogram, who were directly treated surgically because of severe CHF (, ).
