To study ethylene production in , the  core model iAF1260 was modified to build a focused metabolic network for heterologous ethylene production. The core model contains 95 reactions and 72 metabolite species, derived from the iAF1260 genome scale reconstruction () . Ethylene production was modeled according to the  EFE reaction . The BIGG (), KEGG (), and Ecocyc databases () were used to locate the additional reactions and metabolites needed to complete the model . Complete lists of the 114 reactions and 89 metabolites in the core ethylene producing model are available in the Supplement (Tables S2-S3 in  and ). Out of the 114 reactions in the core metabolic model, 66 reactions are reversible, and 48 reactions are irreversible. Unless otherwise stated, presented results are derived from the ethylene core model. For genome scale studies, the EFE reaction was added to the  iAF1260 and the iJO1366 models , . Modifications and constraints applied to the core and genome scale models are described in the following sections and summarized in Supplementary Information (Table S1 in ). MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) was used with the Gurobi Optimizer (Gurobi Optimization, ) to execute each FBA linear programming problem. All models were modified and solved using the COBRA toolbox . Constrictor software and SBML models created for this report are provided at .
