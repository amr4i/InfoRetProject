First, we find that  may be grown in rich media without inhibiting MCP formation, despite suggestions in the literature that growth on a poor carbon source is required , . While we observe that glucose inhibits MCP expression, this inhibition can be circumvented by overexpression of the transcription factor PocR, supporting previous studies that indicated the global Crp regulatory mechanism acts on P rather than directly on P . The ability to form MCPs in a variety of media may prove useful for the biotechnology community, as the growth rate of  is higher in many common rich media when compared to NCE minimal media.
