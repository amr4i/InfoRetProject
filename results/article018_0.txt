Many commercially available recombinant proteins, especially small and non-glycosylated proteins, are produced in . Although this expression system has many advantages, including rapid expression, high yields, ease of culture and low cost , the proteins recovered may be contaminated by endotoxin. This highly complex lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of most gram-negative bacteria and is regarded as the main virulence factor of the latter . LPS is recognized by a receptor complex composed of TLR4, CD14 and MD-2 . Upon recognition and binding of microbial ligands by the extracellular domains of this receptor complex, the intracellular portion recruits adaptor kinases which enable signal transduction, most likely through activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) , . In human monocytes and macrophages these transcriptional responses culminate in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12 , .
