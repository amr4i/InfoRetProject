Furthermore, we confirmed lymphocyte development in the thymus, spleen, and MLNs by immunohistochemistry using CD3 as a lymphocyte marker (). There were numerous CD3 T cells in the medulla of the thymus (), the periarterial lymphatic sheaths of the spleen (), and the surrounding lymphoid follicles of MLNs () in wild-type piglets. In contrast to wild-type piglets, the thymus, spleen, and MLNs of the  KO piglets showed loss of CD3 T cells ().
