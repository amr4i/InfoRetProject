Following either the centrifugation or filtration of samples, the amounts of viable  DSM 4688 cells were quantified in parallel by qPCR and EMA-qPCR. For this, serial dilutions of cells suspended in NaCl were used, and results were compared to microbiological cell enumeration. Without the addition of EMA, qPCR-based quantification detected significantly (<0.05) higher numbers of cells (+0.780.184 SD log CFU/ml) in the filtered samples compared to the microbiological reference method after centrifugation of samples (). However, EMA-qPCR results of the centrifuged samples were comparable (>0.05) with microbiological cell counts. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to calculate the relationship between cell numbers determined by qPCR or EMA-qPCR, and microbiological cell counts; despite the shift of the curves, a high correlation between microbiological cell enumeration and qPCR results without EMA (R = 0.925) and with EMA (R = 0.866) was obtained ().
