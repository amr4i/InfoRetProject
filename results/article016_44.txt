Another limitation of CVU and a potential direction of future work is the inability to represent networks from multiple modalities or include network attributes in a single file, as in the Connectome Toolkit where data is stored in the XML-based Connectome File Format . Other file formats such as the recent CIFTI-2 specification utilize similar flexibility. However, the choice to use regular matrix file formats instead possesses several benefits: use of more general file formats reduces software dependencies and ensures data transparency. Data transparency facilitates understanding of the software design and ensures that it is easy for users to create connectivity data using any methods, and additionally simplifies the identification of software bugs. CVU can natively and quickly calculate many common network metrics that might be stored in larger connectome files, and any attributes that CVU cannot generate natively could be saved individually in multiple files. The inclusion of whole-connectome inputs in future versions of CVU is a potential direction of future development, as more analysis tools are developed to make use of formats such as CIFTI-2.
