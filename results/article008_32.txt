Run charts have several advantages over control charts. First, run charts are easier to construct and teach. Pen and paper is all it takes. Second, run charts make no assumptions about the theoretical distribution of data, which make them especially useful when baseline data are not available to characterise the process prior to a control chart analysis. Third, when using the shift and crossings rules proposed in this study rather than the usual fixed signal limits, the false signal rate is independent of the number of data points. Finally, as our results show, the run chart rules we propose have higher sensitivity and specificity to moderate (~1.5 SD) changes in process performance than the sigma rule alone.
