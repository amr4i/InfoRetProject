The increase in  as well as FGF receptor mRNA WISH signal in  mutants suggests that FGF signaling levels may also be increased. To address this issue we analyzed expression of the FGF downstream target genes  and  by WISH in  embryos. Expression of ETS related protein () was analyzed at 3 dpf (), and of polyoma enhancer activator 3 () at 1, 2 and 3 dpf ( and data not shown). The experiments revealed that WISH signals for mRNA levels of  and  were stronger in  mutants at 2 and 3 dpf ( MHB, telencephalon, hypothalamus each p = 0.028;  cHyp p = 0.008, lens p = 0.029).  WISH signal was not increased at 1 dpf (data not shown). Increased expression of downstream targets of the FGF signaling pathway suggest increased FGF signaling levels in  mutants, although due to the nature of the  mutation in a gene affecting transcript stability, we cannot exclude that the increased  and  signals may be caused by increased transcript stability.
