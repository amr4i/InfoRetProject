In a zebrafish genetic screen for mutations affecting expression pattern and level of  mRNA as marker for DA and noradrenergic (NA) neurons, we identified a mutation in the  gene. The mutant phenotype is attenuated during early developmental stages by maternally derived functional Cnot8 protein, which gradually decays as development proceeds.  mutant embryos display increased  transcript levels and increased numbers of DA neurons particularly in the caudal hypothalamus. The hypothalamic DA phenotype may be caused by direct effects on  mRNA stability, or by changes in levels of developmental regulators controlling formation of caudal hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons. We find that  as well as FGF receptor genes are expressed at higher levels in the caudal hypothalamus in  mutant embryos. Our data suggest that Cnot8, as Caf1 in yeast  and POP2 in  , may have a function in mRNA turnover in zebrafish. Rendering the Cnot8 protein non-functional may result in decreased mRNA decay rates for many but not all developmental regulators, and thus accumulation of those mRNAs. The detailed analysis of genes affected by Cnot8 deficiency in the caudal hypothalamus led us to identify FGF signaling, and specifically Fgf3, as pathway contributing to the specification of the proper number of DA neurons in the caudal hypothalamus.
