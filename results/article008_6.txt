Chen has proposed an alternative way of performing the runs test . Instead of looking at the number of runs, Chen suggests to look at the number of shifts (crossings) in the sequence. In a run chart crossings are easily counted by counting the number of times the graph crosses the median line. The number of crossings in a random sequence will follow a binomial distribution with success probability of 0.5. Thus, the lower 5% prediction value for number of crossings is the lower 5th percentile from the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution with a success probability of 0.5 and n  1 trials where n is the number of useful observations, that is, observations that do not fall on the median. The lower limit can be looked up in a statistical table or calculated using a spreadsheet or statistical software. For example, with a run chart of 20 data points,  than 6 crossings would indicate that the process is shifting.
