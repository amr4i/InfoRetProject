Modular structures for the multi-modal networks shown in  and  is displayed in . In , all modules found by a modularity maximization algorithm are displayed. In 5B, nodes in each modality from a single, automatically generated module corresponding closely to the default mode network  are isolated. Notably, the modules from Q-space diffusion imaging and MEG do not show perfect overlap with the classic default mode network, and especially so in the MEG network where the module contains sensory and motor regions. However, this result is not unexpected. Although previous attempts to isolate the default mode network using resting state MEG have been variously successful, they show that in MEG the default mode network is transient and that cross-hemispheric connectivity in homologous regions is sparse at frequencies above 12 Hz , .
