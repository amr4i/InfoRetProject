At 30C, HIV RNA maintained stability in EDTA plasma until 48 hours (0.12 log reduction). At 168 hours there was a significant decline of 0.74 log copies/mL, with continued declines at 336 hours (1.6 log copies/mL decline) , . Assuming a linear degradation of RNA in these samples, and using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression, the stability threshold was surpassed after 127 hours, though this analysis is limited by the lack of data between 48 and 168 hours and by the fact that there is little data to assume a linear pattern of degradation under these conditions. After 168 hours at 37C, the difference in means was 0.92 log copies/mL . At 22C, there was limited (0.03 log copies/mL) and insignificant decline after 168 hours. Due to insufficient time points at 22C and 37C, no figures are presented with results from these EDTA samples.
