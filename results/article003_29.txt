The upregulation or specific expression of some enzymes in F4 might play a key role in its strong pathogenicity. Among the F4-specific proteins, amidase likely helps this fungus to efficiently adhere to banana root, a key first event in infection by pathogenic microorganism. Autolysin amidase in  promotes an efficient listerial adherence to mouse hepatocyte, and thus listerial pathogenicity . This process depends on the activation of glycosaminoglycan in  . Glycosaminoglycan, as a main extracellular matrix component, plays important roles in cell communication through binding to several proteins . Similar to glycans, sulfur is also a vital element for all living organisms. Once sulfide is synthesized, it is condensed with -acetyl-L-serine under the catalytic action of serine lyase or cysteine synthetase. Serine acetyltransferase and -acetyl serine lyase can form a multi-enzyme complex in bacteria. In addition, the cysteine molecule may play a crucial role in the redox signaling of different stress processes , . Our proteomic results demonstrate that -acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase is upregulated (spot 63) or induced (spot 18) in F4. Therefore, F4 might be relatively more sensitive to changes in redox conditions in plant cells compared with F1. Serine-type carboxypeptidase cleaves the C-terminal peptide bond in peptides, thereby releasing the terminal amino acid . This peptidase is widely observed in fungi, plants, and animals and has diverse biological functions . In , this enzyme is required for normal hyphal growth, and the deletion strain formes fewer conidia on agar plates . We identified two protein spots in F4 as carboxypeptidase, indicating that carboxypeptidase might be important for hyphal growth and conidiation of .
