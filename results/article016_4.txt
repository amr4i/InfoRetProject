Mapping the human connectome non-invasively is currently being pursued using multiple imaging technologies. Connectomics has focused most closely on resting state fMRI  and diffusion MRI . However, network studies of resting state electrophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), which directly measure neural currents at high temporal resolution , as well as networks derived from cortical thickness measurements , have also been used. Many different analysis techniques exist to estimate connectivity in the brain in each of these modalities.
