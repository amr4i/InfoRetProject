Although MH showed anti-depression and gastrointestinal prokinetic effects in animal experiments, several questions were unanswered. In addition to the therapeutic effect, the safety of MH was one of the primary concerns. According to various reports, drug interactions could lead to serious adverse events or decreased drug efficacy. These interactions might occur through the inhibition or induction of hepatic and intestinal drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYPs) and transporters (e.g., p-glycoprotein) , . CYP-mediated drug interactions was a major concern because CYP enzymes are involved in the phase metabolism of more than 70% of prescription drugs , and to the best of our knowledge, there was little published information about the metabolism of MH. In this study, we examined the CYP enzymes responsible for the metabolism of MH and the potential interactions of MH with typical substrates of the CYP enzymes .
