In a recent study, Rag-1-deficient rats were reported by two groups , . Although their Rag-1 mutant rats completely lacked Rag-1 protein and exhibited a hypoplastic thymus, they retained a small quantity of CD3-positive T cells or IgM-positive B cells , . These differences in lymphocytes differentiation were ascribable to translation from an internal methionine without an N-terminal BIAA in the case of frame shift-mutated Rag-1 protein truncated in front of the nonamer binding region . Our gene targeting scheme disrupted the coding sequence in Exon 2, 1.3 kb downstream from the initiator codon, leading to the inactivation of the porcine Rag-1 gene through antibiotic resistance genes similarly to Rag-1 KO mice . Our results show that the function of Rag-1 gene was completely blocked on Rag-1 KO piglets.
