We established a high resolution genetic mapping pannel consisting of 672 F2 embryos representing 1344 meioses from crosses of the original isolate  into AB and HK strain polymorphic strains, providing approximately 0.07 cM resolution. Whole genome scan analysis using SSLP markers  linked the  mutation to chromosome 21. To yield additional polymorphic markers for fine mapping, genomic sequences in the critical region were obtained from Ensembl (Zv6, 7 and 8) genome browser and primer pairs for candidate SSLP markers were generated using the Zebrafish SSR search website, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown USA. (). Fine mapping was performed using DNA from single embryos. BX294656.8 3p (forward, ; reverse, ); CR855270.17 p9 (forward, ; reverse, -3); BX927237 p4 (forward, ; reverse, -3); Zv8_scaffold2513.6 p2 (forward, ; reverse, -3). Listed SSLP markers were also used to genotype  embryos. The full length  ORF was amplified from cDNA of 3 dpf  mutant embryos and wild-type siblings (cnot8 p4 forward, ; reverse, ). PCR conditions: 94C 2 min; 94C 1 min; 60C 1 min, 72C 2 min, 30 cycles. Partial  ORF was amplified from genomic DNA confirming the premature stop codon in  mutants (cnot8stop p1 forward, ; reverse, ). PCR conditions: 94C 2 min; 94C 1 min; 60C 1 min, 72C 2 min, 30 cycles.
