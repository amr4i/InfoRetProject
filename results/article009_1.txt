Deadenylation is thought to be the initial step in bulk mRNA turnover  and is first mediated by the Pab1p-dependent poly (A) nuclease (PAN2-PAN3) complex trimming the poly (A) tail to a length of 60 to 80 nucleotides , . Subsequently the Ccr4-Not complex removes the remaining poly (A) tail finally exposing the mRNA to decapping and decay mechanisms. The Ccr4-Not complex is conserved from yeast to human . In yeast the Ccr4-Not complex is the main deadenylase and comprises 9 core components . Ccr4 associated factor 1 (Caf1) and Carbon catabolite repression factor 4 (Ccr4) are the only subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex involved in 3 to 5 deadenylase activity , . Caf1 has a second function in associating Ccr4 to the Ccr4-Not complex .  and  are homologs of the yeast  gene in zebrafish, mouse, and human. Instead, in  only one homolog () has been identified , , . In vertebrates the Ccr4-Not complex contains the three proteins Ccr4, Cnot8 and Cnot7, dispatching deadenylase function (reviewed in ). Whereas the biochemical roles of  and  in the mRNA decay pathway are well studied, and functions have been determined in cell culture (for example, ) as well as invertebrate systems, it so far is not well understood whether they may also contribute to differential control of mRNA turnover during development and differentiation in vertebrates. Cnot7 has been shown to be required for normal spermatogenesis in mice , but for Cnot8 mouse phenotypes have not been reported.
