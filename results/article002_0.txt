Microcompartments (MCPs) are structures utilized by bacteria to organize and sequester enzymes and the biochemical pathways they catalyze . Various bacterial MCP systems share a general arrangement of an outer protein shell, made up of thousands of subunits, which contains encapsulated metabolic enzymes within its lumen . The propanediol utilization (Pdu) MCP, found in several species of enteric bacteria, encapsulates enzymes involved in the metabolism of 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD) . Twenty-one genes involved in the Pdu pathway are located on the  operon and are regulated by the P promoter , . The encapsulation of the first few steps in this metabolic pathway sequesters the toxic intermediate propionaldehyde , . It is to be noted, however, that synthesizing the thousands of proteins required for Pdu MCP formation comes at a high energy cost. Therefore, regulating the  operon and limiting MCP formation only to environments containing the substrate 1,2-PD is critical for cell fitness. In fact, due to this requirement for a specific metabolite to form MCPs, the Pdu MCP remained elusive to biologists for many years despite its presence in many well-studied organisms such as .
