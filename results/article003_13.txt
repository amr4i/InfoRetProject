Therefore, we carried out 2-DE for F1 and F4 proteins isolated from mycelia after culturing for 2, 4 and 6 days. The representative gels for both races at the different times are presented in . More than 900 protein spots were reproducibly detected on each GAP-stained gel. Some of these spots showed quantitative or qualitative changes over time. Both F1 and F4 showed some changes in their 2-DE profiles over time, and the differences were more obvious at different days (). Quantitative image analysis demonstrated that 136 protein spots were significantly changed in the two races (p<0.05) by> two-fold for at least one time point. Compared with F1, there were 24 up-regulated spots, 23 down-regulated spots, and 28 race-specific spots observed in F4 ().
