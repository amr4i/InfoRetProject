The pcDNA3 human FOXO1 and FOXO1-CA expression plasmids were previously described . The pALTER human FOXO1, FOXO1-CA, and FOXO1-CA-DNA binding domain (DBD) mutant (W209G/H215L) expression vectors were generously provided by Dr. Terry Unterman . The pRK5 SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Rik Derynck. The 1000 murine -luciferase (luc) in pGL3 and 5 truncations (500, 304, 95) were previously described , , . The 4XSBE-luc containing four repeats of a consensus SBE () was obtained from Dr. Djurdjica Coss. The 4FBE-luc was constructed by inserting four repeats of a consensus Forkhead binding element (FBE) () upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter in pGL3 using KpnI and NheI restriction enzyme sites as was the 4XFL2BE-luc containing four repeats of a consensus FOXL2 binding element (FLRE) () .
