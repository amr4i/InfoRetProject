Total RNA was extracted from LT2 cells with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Contaminating DNA was removed with DNA- reagent (Life Technologies). 2 g of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in an iQ5 iCycler using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) and the following primers:  forward, ;  reverse, ; Gapdh forward, ; Gapdh reverse, , under the following conditions: 95C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95C for 45 sec, 54C for 45 sec, and 72C for 45 sec. Each sample was assayed in triplicate and the experiment was repeated three times. Standard curves with dilutions of a plasmid containing  or  cDNA were generated with the samples in each run. In each experiment, the amount of  was calculated by comparing the threshold cycle obtained for each sample with the standard curve generated in the same run. Replicates were averaged and divided by the mean value of  in the same sample. After each run, a melting curve analysis was performed to confirm that a single amplicon was generated in each reaction.
