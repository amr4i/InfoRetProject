The chloroplast co-chaperonin system continues to challenge us with structural and functional divergence from the  system. One major difference is the existence of a double co-chaperonin gene (cpn20) whose protein product seems to form tetrameric complexes. The second is the existence of multiple co-chaperonin homologs in plastids. In some organisms the cpn10 gene is duplicated, in some cpn20 and in some, there are multiple copies of both , , . A third difference, only recently discovered, is the ability of distinct co-chaperonin species to form functional hetero-oligomers .  harbors three expressed co-chaperonin subunits in its chloroplast, none of which is active on its own. Upon mixing, a range of different hetero-oligomeric species can be formed. However, only combinations incorporating the CrCpn10 subunit exhibit any co-chaperonin activity . Thus, it seems that in  system the hetero-oligomer is obligatory for function.
