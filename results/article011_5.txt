The synchronized PC3 cells were incubated with 0.5 M of CPT (Sigma), 0.5 M of CFS-1686, and DMSO, respectively, for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hr. Then the cells were subjected to sonification and centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was determined by a protein assay kit (PIERCE). About 40 g of protein/per well was resolved in electrophoresis aparatus. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The transferred membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST (0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4) and probed for antibody against ATM (Cell Signaling), Phospho-ATM (Ser-1981; Cell Signaling), H2AX (Cell Signaling), PARP, caspase 3 activation form and GAPDH (Cell Signaling), followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated horseradish peroxidase (anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, anti-goat; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and visualization with chemoluminiscence substrate (Millipore) using the chemoluminiscence detection system (BIO-RAD) or exposing to X-ray film.
