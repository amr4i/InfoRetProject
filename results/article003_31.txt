Many glycoside hydrolases were found to be overrepresented in F4. These enzymes are responsible for the hydrolysis of sugar residues and polysaccharides. The chitinolytic enzymes chitinase and hexosaminidase were identified in F4-specific spots in this research. Chitinase hydrolyzes -1,4 linkages in chitin polymers, endolytically producing chitooligosaccharide and chitobiose. Although hexosaminidase does not directly hydrolyze chitin polymers, it has high acetylhexosaminidase activity, which helps to degrade chitooligosaccharide into monomers . Overexpression of chitinase 3 gene can improved fungal cell wall formation in both hyphal tips and germinated spores . The exo-acting galactosidase enzyme mainly cleaves -1-6-linked -galactosyl residues into oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and synthetic substrates. Upon infection with  and , maize grain produces some hydrolytic enzymes, such as galactosidase, glucosidase and glucosaminidase, which enable the fumonisin-producing  to rapidly infect living maize grain . In our study, chitinase and -galactosidase were specially expressed in F4 (), which might help this race to efficiently infect banana plants.
