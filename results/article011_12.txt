We then examined the levels of DNA double-strand breakage in CPT- and CFS-1686-treated cells using an antibody against H2AX, which is the target of ATM and a DNA double-strand break marker . As expected, H2AX appeared and became saturated after 2 hrs of CPT treatment (), right after CPT-induced ATM activation (). In contrast, H2AX started to appear after 2 hr and reached saturation after 4 hr in CFS-1686-treated cells (), also correlating with the timing of ATM phosphorylation (). We further examined the formation of H2AX foci in the cells treated with CPT or CFS-1686 and demonstrated that CFS-1686 induces many light and small spots mixed with DNA while CPT induces the obvious H2AX foci mixed with DNA (). These results suggested that CPT might cause much higher degree of DNA damage than that of CFS-1686.
