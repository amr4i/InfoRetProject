To obtain additional direct evidence of hetero-oligomer formation, we analyzed mixtures of Cpn20 and Cpn10 by gel filtration. Fractions eluting from the column were separated by both native and denaturing electrophoresis. In , left panel, it can be seen that Cpn10(1) by itself elutes from the column in fractions 1924, while Cpn20 elutes in fractions 1418. Upon mixing the two co-chaperonins, a shift was seen in the elution profile of Cpn10(1), with additional Cpn10(1) observed in fractions 1518, the area of Cpn20 elution. The same fractions were separated on native acrylamide gels (, right panel). Consistent with the formation of hetero-oligomer, elution of the Cpn10(1)-Cpn20 mixture yielded an additional band (marked by an arrow) above the Cpn20 band, in fractions 1518. These results confirm the formation of a novel species containing both subunit types.
