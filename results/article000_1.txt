Assessments of microbiological water quality generally focus on testing for indicator bacteria, like , which are used to estimate the exposure of drinking water to faecal contamination , . Nevertheless, the onset of human  infections or outbreaks may necessitate the inclusion of thermotolerant  in microbial water analyses , . Water analysis laboratories often use the ISO standard method 17995:2005 , which initially includes a filtration step of the water samples, followed by bacterial enrichment and cultivation on selective agar plates. However, the ISO method is time consuming and often fails to detect  from water samples . This may be the result of higher amounts of injured or viable but nonculturable (VBNC) cells under stressful environmental conditions, as is the case in water . To circumvent the limitations of culture-based methods, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) approaches for the detection of  from water have been developed and successfully applied , , , . However, the lack of differentiation between DNA from viable and nonviable cells restricts the implementation of these PCR-based techniques for routine diagnostic applications . Recently, a sample pretreatment with intercalating dyes like ethidium monoazide (EMA) or propidium monoazide (PMA) was proposed to address this problem. These dyes cross the membranes of damaged cells, covalently bind to DNA after photoactivation, and, thus, block PCR amplification of DNA from nonviable cells . EMA- or PMA-qPCR assays have been successfully used to quantify  from poultry products , ,  but little is known about the applicability of a viability qPCR to determine the quantities of  from water samples , .
