In this study, 99 of the 136 differentially expressed protein spots were positively identified by either PMF or MS/MS (; ), including 59 unique proteins. The PMF spectra, peptide sequences, and Mascot searched results are listed in detail in the . A few spots were identified as being the same protein or representing isoforms. For example, seven spots (spots 5, 8690, and 92) were identified as catalase-peroxidase, four as ATP synthase (spots 38, 40, 46, and 49), four as phosphoglycerate kinase (spots 7, 13, 31, and 36), four as hexosaminidase (spots 12, 14, 35, and 98), four as galactosidase (spots 42, 43, 80, and 83), and four as l-amino acid oxidase (spots 39, 82, 84, and 91). Many highly abundant proteins, such as Mn-superoxide dismutase (spots 6, 15, and 28), NADP-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase (spots 4, 25, and 27), vacuolar protease A (spots 23, 24, and 29), and phospholipase B (spots 7678) also had several protein isoforms (; ).
