One of the questions that arises from our data concerns the gain of activity exhibited by G32A (the Cpn20 mutant bearing a mutation in the N-domain mobile loop) at 37C when supplemented with a very small concentration of Cpn10(1), which is itself inactive (). It was previously demonstrated that at least four functional GroES subunits out of seven are necessary for binding GroEL . Assuming one C-terminal domain of the Cpn20 molecule is excluded from the ring as previously suggested , this leaves only three functional C-domain subunits out of seven domains, which could explain the non-functionality of the tetrameric G32A oligomer. Upon addition of Cpn10(1), the number of intact subunits rises to four, which could allow the binding to the chaperonin and result in a functional complex.
