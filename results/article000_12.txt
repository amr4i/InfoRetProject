The results from the physicochemical and microbiological analyses of pond and tap water samples are shown in . As was expected from the visual assessment, the turbidity of pond water was much higher (128.8 NTU) than that of tap water (0.17 NTU). This finding was also reflected in a more than 4-fold higher content of total organic carbon in the pond water sample. While the concentrations of most cations and anions were comparable, the microbiological analysis revealed a total viable count of bacteria of approximately 10 CFU/ml and the presence of enterococci (67 CFU/100 ml) in the pond water sample. Contamination with  spp. was detected in neither pond nor tap water samples.
