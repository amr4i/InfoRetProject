Unlike in rodents and -biallelic mutant pigs, coat color changed in our  KO piglets. We used donor cells derived from Duroc fetuses. As shown in the wild-type figure (), Duroc piglets have a dark brown coat. On the other hand, the coat of -deficient piglets was discolored. It is known that DNA methylation and epigenetic changes can be caused by SCNT , and phenotypic and epigenetic variation resulting in depigmentation has been reported in cloned pigs , . In a study of piglets cloned using Duroc donor cells , one of nine cloned piglets exhibited depigmentation of the skin and hair. It is possible that the downregulation of certain genes induced this depigmentation, although the changes occurred during puberty. However, both our -deficient piglets generated showed the same coat color accompanying the T-B-SCID phenotype. Therefore, the discoloration in -deficient piglets may result from the  gene KO rather than an effect of cloning in colored pig breeds. The cause of this coat discoloration phenomenon is unknown, and further study is necessary to elucidate the relationship between coat coloration and  disruption in colored pigs.
