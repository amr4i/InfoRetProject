We then used a modified DNA cleavage assay to investigate whether CFS-1686 interacted with Top1 to inhibit religation of Top1-mediated DNA cleavage. The results clearly demonstrated that CPT inhibited religation of DNA cleavage at concentrations as low as 12.5 M, resulting in the disappearance of the long length compacted DNA (). CFS-1686 had totally no effect on this action, but nevertheless it reduced CPT-induced DNA cleavage in dose-dependent manner (). We speculated that CFS-1686 might inhibit Top1 activity by a different mechanism than CPT to affect the interaction of Top1 with DNA and preclude formation of the Top1-DNA complex.
