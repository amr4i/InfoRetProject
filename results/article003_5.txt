The frozen collected mycelia were added to protein extraction buffer at a ratio of 1:3 (w/v) to isolate proteins by the borax/PVPP/phenol protocol  with minor modifications as described . The air-dried protein pellets were dissolved in the lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 13 mM dithiothreitol), and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-160, Kyoto, Japan). Bovine serum albumin was used as standard.
