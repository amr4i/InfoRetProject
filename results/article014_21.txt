The inactive mutant G32A was also useful as a tool allowing us to examine hetero-oligomers formed by Cpn10(2) and Cpn20. We found that titration of Cpn10(2) on a background of 20 M G32A resulted in a significant increase in GroEL activity (). For example, at a 0.25 ratio of [co-chaperonin]/[GroEL]), where the refolding yield is sub-saturating for Cpn10(2) alone, the addition of G32A resulted in an approximately 5-fold increase in refolding activity (8.95% versus 46.16% respectively). Addition of G32A to Cpn10(2) also resulted in greater refolding yields using Cpn60, however, the increase was less apparent. At a 0.25 ratio of [co-chaperonin]/[Cpn60], Cpn10(2) gave a refolding yield of 18.06%, vs 29.15% in the presence of G32A (). These results indicate that functional hetero-oligomers are formed between Cpn20 and Cpn10(2), as previously demonstrated . Similar experiments titrating Cpn10(2) on a background of 20 M Cpn10(1) did not yield an increase in activity over that of Cpn10(2) alone (not shown), suggesting that the two Cpn10s may not assemble to form hetero-oligomeric species with each other.
