A representative solution (, of length ) to this linear programming problem is determined for the baseline strain without any genetic modifications. Though alternate optimal solutions exist with equivalent maximized ethylene production , in this case as in others it is not necessary to determine the range of flux variability , , , , here because the intention is to generate derivative flux distributions corresponding to modifications of target reactions. Thus, we select one representative baseline solution as the starting point on which the Constrictor algorithm is subsequently applied. Constrictor targets metabolic reactions by constricting the lower and upper bounds of flux through the targeted reaction(s) at Minor and Major levels (). Scalar restriction factors  and  are coefficients that are used to modulate the upper and lower bounds of the targeted metabolic reaction(s) at Minor and Major levels (). The restriction factors are user defined, range between 0 and 1, and represent percentage reductions in flux. Unless otherwise specified, the restriction factors  and  are set to 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. For a set of  metabolic reactions targeted by Constrictor (input into the vector ), all possible combinations of  and  are generated (). Each targeted reaction is multiplied by the baseline flux value to define specific expression values (, ), where  = 1 through .
