The proportions of each water-soluble ion also presented a clear pattern. The concentrations of the ions were: NO> SO> NH> Cl> Ca> K> Na> F> Mg in spring and autumn; SO> NO> NH> Cl> Na> Ca> K> Mg> F in summer; and SO> NO> NH> Cl> K> Ca> Na> F> Mg in winter. In PM, the concentrations of NO, SO, NH and Cl were significantly higher than those of the remaining five ions, comprising 90.392.3% of the total mass of water-soluble ions in each season. The total concentrations of these four dominant ions exceeded 70 g/m in all samples. PM had similar ion species characteristics to PM. Four dominant ions contributed 86.1%-88.6% of the total mass of water-soluble ions in each season, ranging from 37195 g/m. The concentrations of Ca, K and Na were comparatively low, with average concentrations of 2.90, 2.27 and 1.82 g/m, respectively in PM and slightly higher average concentrations in PM. Mg and F combined contributed less than 0.5% of the total mass of ionic species. The concentration of F at the Shijiazhuang site ranged from 0.0142.436 g/m in PM and from 0.0463.473 g/m in PM, an average concentration more than threefold greater than those at Beijing and Tianjin.
