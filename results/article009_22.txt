We further investigated potential differential functins of Cnot8 in development using DA neural differentiation as model system. Early differentiating DA neurons of the DC2, 4, and 5 groups, and noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus form during the first 36 hours of development, and appear normal in  mutant embryos. During these time periods sufficient functional Cnot8 may be present in  mutants as a result of maternally deposited  mRNA. In contrast, cell counts of DA cells in the ventral diencephalon and hypothalamus showed that DA cell number was significantly increased in the caudal hypothalamic DC7 group in  mutants compared to WT siblings. An increase in the number of scored cells was also observed for CRH neurons, but not for serotonergic neurons located adjacent to DC7 DA neurons. Therefore, the effect of Cnot8 depletion is not selective for DA neurons, but also does not globally affect all neuronal types in this region and at this stage. The increase in number of counted cells may be caused by a true increase in number of DC7 DA neurons in mutant embryos, but may alternatively also be explained by increased  mRNA levels due to less decay, which may facilitate detection of newly specified DC7 DA neurons which in wildtype controls express too little  to be detected by the technique. However, based on the fact that selective interference with Fgf3 signaling can compensate the formation of supernumerary DC7 DA neurons, we think that indeed additional DA neurons are observed in  mutant embryos.
