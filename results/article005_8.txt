Where the vector  represents the baseline flux through each of  reactions and  is the stoichiometric matrix for the reaction network. For the majority of results presented, we maximize ethylene production in order to study maximum theoretical ethylene yield, while enforcing a minimum growth rate in order to simulate metabolically relevant flux distributions. To demonstrate that alternate objectives are supported, we also describe a study that maximizes growth (via biomass reactions). The  and  vectors contain the lower and upper bounds of the flux for each reaction, respectively, and limits are placed on ATP maintenance, glucose uptake, and oxygen uptake (). Other reactions are allowed to vary between -v to v mmol/gdcw/hr for reversible reactions, and 0 to v mmol/gdcw/hr for irreversible reactions. We set v to 1000 mmol/gdcw/hr indicating unlimited flux through each reaction of the metabolic network. Steady state conditions are assumed, such that the rate of metabolite change in the system is equal to zero.
