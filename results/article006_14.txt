ATVMS has been reported to be an important factor for SC or defect size diminution, with more favorable PMVSD prognosis , , , which is in accordance with our findings. However, in contrast to previous reports, we classified ATVMS formation into 3 grades in which no ATVMS formation (grade 0) and tumor-like bulge shaped toward the right ventricle (grade 2) were significantly associated with spontaneous PMVSD closure. Although Shirali et al. noted that the likelihood of SC could be more accurately predicted by the indexed defect size than ATVMS formation , our study suggests that both VSD diameter and ATVMS formation are significant predictors.
