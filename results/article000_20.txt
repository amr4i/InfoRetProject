Second, the influence of water types was investigated with regard to the EMA-qPCR approach. Fluorescence microscopy detected a significant higher proportion of nonviable cells after inoculation of  cells in pond water, whereas the proportions in tap water and NaCl were comparable. This result could suggest that the microbial background in pond water, which could not be completely excluded in experiments even after sterile filtration, was responsible for the high percentage of nonviable cells (81.59%) . One should bear in mind that the live/dead differentiation of intercalating dyes, such as EMA, is only based on the membrane integrity of cells, whereas penetration into the cell is not selective for a certain bacterial species . As was expected from our findings and from previous publications , , , intercalating dyes are unable to sufficiently suppress signals from higher numbers of nonviable cells. Therefore, it is suggested that EMA-qPCR failed to detect the correct quantities of viable cells in pond water samples due to the high background of dead cells. In addition, a high turbidity of pond water was detected by physicochemical analyses, and these particles may be retained on microfilter membranes during filtration. As a consequence, these particles may be rinsed from the membranes together with bacteria, and may inhibit the photoactivation of EMA, which is necessary to induce binding of the intercalating dye to DNA. However, whether the combined pre-enrichment of samples and qPCR for quantification is an option for analysis of pond water samples, as recently proposed for  from pig carcasses, must be elucidated .
