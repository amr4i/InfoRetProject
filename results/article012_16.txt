In mice, previous experiments have revealed that disruption of Rag-1 or Rag-2 blocks the differentiation of lymphocytes and causes T-B-SCID , . Moreover, Rag-deficient blastocyst complementation allowed the generation of somatic chimeras possessing mature B and T cells, all of which were derived from injected ES cells . In addition, studies on Rag activity in humans have revealed that Rag gene mutations cause T-B-SCID or Omenn syndrome . Rag-1 and Rag-2 interact and the Rag complex functions as a sequence- and structure-specific nuclease during V(D)J recombination . These reports suggest that Rag-1 and Rag-2 and their interaction are important for the differentiation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes in rodents and humans. In this study, FACS analysis showed that, among PBMCs, IgM-positive B cells and CD3-positive T cells were present in wild-type neonatal piglets. In contrast, Rag-1 KO piglets completely lacked both IgM-positive B cells and CD3-positive T cells among their PBMCs. This suggests that the inactivation of Rag-1 blocks the differentiation and proliferation of T and B cells and Rag genes are important for the differentiation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes in pigs, which is similar in mice and humans. These results confirm that Rag-1-deficient pigs exhibit the T-B-SCID phenotype.
