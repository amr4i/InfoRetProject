We used the pNF-B RE-TK hRluc(F) vector (Riken BRC, Ibaraki, Japan), which uses the nucleotide sequence of the NF-B response element found upstream of minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter, in the renilla luciferase reporter construct. RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates (110 cells/well) and cultured overnight. The firefly luciferase normalization vector pCMV-Luc and the renilla luciferase reporter construct pNF-B RE-TK hRluc(F) were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into the RAW264.7 cells, and the transfected cells were cultured for 24 hours. The cells were then cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and LPS (1 g/mL) with or without gentiolactone for 12 hours. The cells were harvested using passive lysis buffer (Promega). Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were determined using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega).
