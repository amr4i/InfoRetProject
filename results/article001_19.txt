These studies were laboratory-based, rather than examining the field impacts of sample transport beyond time and temperature thresholds, with only one study examining PPT transport. Given the logistical constraint of centrifugation, the added value of PPT may be limited if whole blood remains stable in EDTA tubes for extended periods. Additionally the inconsistent assessments of time and temperature thresholds limited comparability across studies.

The impact of sample transport conditions on low and undetectable VLs need to be further examined. The majority of people in these studies had VLs over 3.5 log copies/mL with some not receiving ART. Populations accessing VL monitoring today are generally receiving ART, and VLs in these populations are lower than those not on ART . A 2010 systematic review of virological suppression in adults in sub-Saharan Africa found that 78% had virologically suppressed after 6 months, 76% after 12 months and 67% after 24 months of treatment . While adherence is generally lower among adolescents and young adults, a recent systematic review found that adherence was 84% (95% CI 7989%) in this population in Sub-Saharan Africa . Assessments of HIV RNA stability drawn from these largely undetectable and low viremia populations will be needed for insights on RNA stability at low levels and the potential impact of even minor RNA degradation on clinical decision-making for these populations.
