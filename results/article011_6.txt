510 PC3 cells were plated on sterile 18-mm glass coverslips. Cells were cultured with CFS-1686 or CPT for 12 hours in the presence of CPT or CFS-1686, fixed in methanol (-20C, 10 min) and perforated with 0.1% triton 100 (25C, 2 min). Cells were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin-TBS and then stained with primary H2AX monoclonal antibody followed by secondary antibodies with fluorophores 488 nm or 555 nm (Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted with anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) upside down on glass slides. The images were obtained using confocal microscope (ZEISS) and amplified 63 and 150 times.

The production of human Top1 proteins was carried out using a baculoviral expression system in Sf-9 insect cells. The detailed methods for protein production and purification were described previously .
