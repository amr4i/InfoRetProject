The preparation of compound  is summarized in . Commercially available 3-amino-1-adamantanol ()  was acetylated in water, the solvent of choice for green chemistry.

Compounds  and  were synthesized following the route summarized in  . These compounds were obtained after a reductive amination and in three steps from the commercially available 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone (). The synthesis was carried out using the pure enantiomer of the --methylbenzylamine and the 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone refluxing in absolute ethanol. The intermediate compound  was hydrogenated. This hydrogenation with the catalyst Pd/C 10% could have been performed in two steps, isolating the benzylamino derivatives, but it was preferred an overnight hydrogenation to yield compounds  and . The last synthetic step consisted of the acetylation in water of the mixture using the same conditions as for compound  yielding an  mixture of compounds  and  in a 7:3 ratio, with the E isomer being the major product. Compounds  and  were found in a paper by Gonzles-Nuez et al.  but with a different enriched mixture ( 75/25) and not separated for fully characterization. In our case, compounds  and  were purified by automated semipreparative LC-MS for their characterization.
