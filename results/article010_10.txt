The Datong site was used as the control point. It is located in the upwind direction of the study area, and is isolated by the Taihang Mountains. Here too, the dominant ions were NO, SO, NH, and Cl. However, the concentrations were lower than those of the study area (). The concentration of SO in spring was highest in Datong, 11.69 g/m in PM. The average concentration of SO in the study area reached 39.26 g/m, almost 3.4-fold greater than in Datong. The concentrations of the remaining ions in each sample were less than 10 g/m, significantly lower than in the study area.
