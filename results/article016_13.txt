As CVU is a tool for visualization of abstract networks, visualization of individual subject morphology is not always a priority. CVU is designed so that subject specific morphology can be used if necessary; however, for most use cases, an average brain is preferred due to its lower speed and memory requirements, and simpler visualization. For convenience, CVU provides surface and segmentation files for the fsaverage5 brain, as well as a number of parcellation schemes. Specifically, annotations are provided for the multi-resolution surface parcellations described in , as well as the Destrieux and Desikan reconstructions automatically generated by FreeSurfer reconstruction , .
