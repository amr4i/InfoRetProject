Secondary ions have complex reactions. NH readily reacts with SO to the stable form of ammonium salts , , . The reaction of NH and NO is affected by the gas/aerosol distribution of the precursor gases (NH and HNO) in terms of temperature and humidity . [NH] was linearly correlated with the micro-equivalent sum of ([SO]+[NO]) in the three cities. The linear fits of the data were:
