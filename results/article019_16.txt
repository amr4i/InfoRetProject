Benzylimine  (0.33 g, 1.2 mmol) was dissolved in THF (15 mL) and kept at 0C in an ice bath for 5 min. Then, Pd-C 10% (0.24 g) was added and the mixture was hydrogenated at atmospheric pressure for 12h. The catalyst was removed by filtration and the solvent evaporated yielding isomers  and  as a white powder (0.13 g, 67%). M.p. 250C. LC-MS retention time isomer  0.64 min [M+H]  = 168;  isomer 0.95 min [M+H]  = 168.
