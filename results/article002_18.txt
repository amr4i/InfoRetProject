To confirm previous reports  that PocR is a necessary component of Pdu MCP regulation, we generated a  knockout strain in  using Lambda Red-based recombination. In   harboring P-GFP, the addition of 1,2-PD no longer resulted in a shift in fluorescence when measured by flow cytometry (, see also Fig. S7 in ). Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy of   expressing PduP-GFP in the presence of 1,2-PD displayed diffuse fluorescence, indicating that the fusion protein is not localized in the absence of MCPs ().

We next used   harboring P-GFP to demonstrate that expression of PocR from an inducible plasmid can complement the genomic disruption. Indeed, we observed a shift in fluorescence both in the presence and absence of 1,2-PD when PocR expression is induced, as measured by flow cytometry (, see also Fig. S7 in ). Fluorescence microscopy showed that the punctate fluorescence phenotype is restored for   expressing PduP-GFP and PocR even in the absence of 1,2-PD (). TEM images of purified MCPs from strains expressing PocR in the absence of 1,2-PD showed no apparent morphological differences, for both wild type  and  , when compared to MCPs purified from strains induced by 1,2-PD (). TEM images of MCPs purified from a  knockout strain of  expressing PocR in the presence of 20 mM glucose and in the absence of 1,2-PD also appeared morphologically normal (). A western blot against GFP indicates that purified MCPs from  induced by PocR overexpression in the absence of 1,2-PD encapsulated heterologous proteins ().
