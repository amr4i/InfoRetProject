The approach proposed in the present paper is totally different being based on the hypothesis that the replacement of the phenyl ring of paracetamol by an adamantane ring with the same substituents in 1,4-positions, will yield analogues of paracetamol. Adamantyl derivatives are found in medicinal chemistry in very different domains . Adamantane is one of the few singular hydrocarbon moieties that have been successfully employed in pharmaceutical industry. The most popular hit is amantadine used for the treatment of influenza and Parkinson's disease . Related to analgesia and/or inflammation some analogues of -THC such as compound  have been reported () . Quinolone  binds selectively to the cannabinoid CB receptor being endowed with analgesic activity  . Some derivatives from  reported as P2X receptor antagonists acted as agents against rheumatoid arthritis . Amongst the carbohydrazides, the most interesting is  developed by Abbott . As can be seen, none of the structures represented in  is related to our compounds.
