To further support our results, we used a Cpn20 mutant, G32A, which was previously characterized in our laboratory . This Cpn20 mutant is modified at a highly conserved glycine, which was shown to be important for the flexibility of the mobile loop  the region that facilitates binding of co-chaperonin to Cpn60. G32 is located in the N-domain of Cpn20 and its substitution to alanine results in a co-chaperonin which is inactive at 37C. As can be seen in , while both G32A and Cpn10(1) are individually inactive, their combination resulted in ~75% co-chaperonin activity with GroEL () and ~40% using chloroplast Cpn60 (). Thus the presence of small amount of G32A can serve as a template for Cpn10(1) oligomerization, resulting in active mixed oligomers. Reciprocally, the presence of Cpn10(1) molecule in the mixed oligomer is sufficient to fully rescue co-chaperonin activity of the inactive G32A mutant. While the general refolding trends using chloroplast Cpn60 were similar to those using GroEL, some differences were observed in the refolding pattern or yields. For example, Cpn60 refolding yields are much lower with G32A and Cpn10(1), than they are using GroEL. This might be due to a greater sensitivity of Cpn60 to mutations in the endogenous co-chaperonin partner.
