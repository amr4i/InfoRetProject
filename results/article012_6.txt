The original porcine fetal fibroblasts (T6-12),  heterozygous KO cells (#95-2,  PFF), and  homozygous KO cells (#3-55,  PFF), as well as the tail tissues of the -deficient piglets ( No. 1 and No. 2) and wild-type piglets (WT No. 1 and No. 2), were used for genomic PCR analysis. Genomic DNA extraction and PCRs were conducted using a QuickGene DNA Tissue Kit (Fujifilm Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and QuickTaq (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturers' protocols. The primers used to detect the targeted allele 1 vector and heterozygous KO were: P1 () and P2 (). The PCR conditions were: 95C for 1 min, 57C for 1 min, and 72C for 2 min for 35 cycles. The primers used to detect the targeted allele 2 vector and homozygous KO were: P1 and P3 (). The primers used to confirm  deficiency were: Pc1 () and Pc2 (). The PCR conditions were the same. After PCR, 7 l of each PCR products was loaded on to a 1% agarose gel and separated, and the ethidium bromide-stained gel was photographed.
