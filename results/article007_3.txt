Sugar concentration does not only have an impact on the adults energy budget, but plays an important role in brood provisions as well (reviewed in ). All solitary and most eusocial bees (excepting honey bees) mass provision their brood cells, sealing them after the egg has been laid. Provisions commonly consist of pollen with more or less added nectar , , , . The added nectar constitutes up to 99% of the sugar content of provisions , and higher sugar contents in larval provisions have been shown to positively influence the resulting larval weight , . Higher larval weight was discussed as potential factor increasing adult mass and fecundity . Based on this, we investigated whether female  orchid bees have behavioral adaptations relating to the manipulation of sugar concentrations of brood provisions. Here, we focused on  and , two species that readily accept trap nests and thus can be obtained for observation.
