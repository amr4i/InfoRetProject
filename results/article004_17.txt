The drug interactions of MH were one of the critical questions to be resolved. These interactions might occur through the inhibition or induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and lead to serious adverse events or decreased drug efficacy . The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are a large family of drug-metabolizing enzymes that play a critical role in Phase I drug metabolism, and most of the endogenous and exogenous substances are the substrates of CYPs . CYP-mediated drug interactions is a major concern; the inhibition of a CYP enzyme can cause an increase in drug plasma levels via decreased drug metabolism, which could result in significant adverse reactions or toxicities. Therefore, inhibition-based drug interactions are a primary cause of clinically significant drug interactions . The major CYPs involved in the hepatic metabolism of most drugs are CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 ; therefore, screening the CYPs for the metabolism of MH could predict its drug interactions.
