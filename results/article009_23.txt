Our findings reveal elevated  mRNA levels in  mutant embryos, along with elevated levels of expression for the FGF responsive transcription factor genes  and . Given the expression domain of  in the posterior wall of the caudal hypothalamus, we hypothesized that enhanced Fgf3 signaling may be the cause for formation of supernumerary DC7 DA neurons. To test this hypothesis, we blocked FGF signaling using the FGF receptor inhibitor SU5402. While DC7 DA neurons become postmitotic during an extended developmental period , we restricted our analysis to a shorter time window, because permanent global inhibition of FGF signaling affect pattern formation and embryonic survival. However, even when we restricted SU5402 application to 42 to 48 hpf only, we could reduce the wildtype and  mutant DC7 DA population by about half each. More specifically, when we eliminated Fgf3 activity in  mutant embryos, we observed almost complete compensation of the supernumerary DC7 DA neurons in  mutant embryos. These data reveal that Fgf3 signaling contributes to specification of the number of DA neurons in the caudal hypothalamus. However, Fgf3 may not provide the only FGF activity, because residual DC7 DA neurons form in / homozygous mutant embryos. Other FGFs, including Fgf8a , may act redundantly with Fgf3. Fgf8 from the mid-hindbrain boundary has previously been linked to midbrain DA differentiation . An alternative explanation would be that Fgf3 is not directly involved in controlling DC7 DA differentiation, but may rather control the size of the DC7 precursor pool size or proliferation of the precursor pool. A link for Fgf3 signaling to cell cycle control and differentiation in the hypothalamus has also been established for serotonergic neuron differentiation in zebrafish . A regulation of DA neuron number by control of precursor pool size has also been shown for the more rostral posterior tubercular DA neurons in zebrafish, involving WNT signaling .
