The importance of activin signaling in the production of FSH has been illustrated using mouse knockout models. Deletion of the Type II activin receptor as well as gonadotrope-specific knockdown of both SMAD4 and FOXL2 resulted in a hypogonadal hypogonadism phenotype reminiscent of the  knockout . Since FOXO1 was previously reported to interact with SMAD3/4 proteins in HaCAT and Cos-1 cells , we investigated whether FOXO1 could regulate activin induction of  gene expression. We demonstrated that overexpression of constitutively active FOXO1 repressed activin- or activin and GnRH-induced transcription of a murine -luc reporter as well as endogenous  mRNA in LT2 cells (). The FOXO1 repression occurred in a context-dependent manner since FOXO1 overexpression induced transcription of a consensus FBE (). Along with evidence that FOXO1 can suppress basal and GnRH-induced  gene expression , , these data support the idea that nuclear localized FOXO1 may have a significant inhibitory effect on  transcription in gonadotrope cells although it should be noted that overexpression studies can result in responses that do not occur in the  physiological context.
