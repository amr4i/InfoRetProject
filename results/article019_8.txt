Akin to the reference analgesic agents, compounds  and  were administered i.p. 30 minutes before the injection of acetic acid (). The solubility of these derivatives was significantly higher than paracetamol allowing their testing at higher doses, which is a desirable property. Both compounds ( and ) were able to induce a significant antinociceptive effect that was more potent for compound . As illustrated in , compound  displays a similar 40% antinociceptive activity to that recorded with paracetamol. This analgesic effect of compound  displayed some dose-dependency and saturated at 200 mg/kg. In contrast, compound  exhibited stronger analgesic activity than compound , and a clear dose-dependent analgesic activity that saturated at 750 mg/kg. At saturation, compound  displays an analgesic efficacy significantly higher than paracetamol and similar to morphine. Taken together, these results suggest that compound  is a more potent analgesic than paracetamol.

We next investigated the mechanism of action underlying the analgesic activity of analogue . First, we evaluated a possible action on cannabinoid receptors. For this purpose, compound  was administered 30 minutes before the selective CB1 AM251 (3 mg/kg i.p.) and CB2 AM630 (1 mg/kg, i.p) antagonists, and the writhing test was carried out 30 minutes after the administration of the antagonists. Neither the CB1 nor the CB2 antagonist was able to block the antinociceptive activity of compound  (number of stretches 131 (AM251) and 15.51.7 (AM630). Thus, the cannabinoid system does not appear to play a significant role in the antinociception induced by the paracetamol derivatives  and .
