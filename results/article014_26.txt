The ability of a small percentage of unique chaperonin (Cpn60) subunits to confer specificity of the system for a distinct client protein was clearly demonstrated by Peng et al. , for the Cpn604 subunit, which is incorporated in small amounts into the oligomer and dictates specificity of the chaperonin for folding of the NdhH protein. Deletion of Cpn604 did not affect housekeeping functions of the plant compared to wild type, although a specific function of the chaperonin complex was impaired. For the co-chaperonins, Cpn10(1) and Cpn10(2) can be found at concentrations much lower than those of Cpn20, and knock-out strains of these genes in  exhibit a wild-type phenotype under the tested conditions . In a similar manner to the Cpn604, it seems likely that their incorporation into co-chaperonin hetero-oligomers even at a low ratio is likely to affect the biogenesis of specific proteins that have yet to be discovered.
