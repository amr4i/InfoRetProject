Since decreasing glucose uptake improved yield in mutants A and B, we next examined the impact of fixing glucose uptake to 10.5 mmol/gdcw/hr during Constrictor analysis. Under this constraint none of the expression states lead to increased yield, though increased growth rates are noted when reactions in glycolysis are targeted ( and ,  and Table S4 in ). Restricting glycolysis forces flux to divert through the pentose phosphate pathway, increasing production of biomass precursors. Again, restricting certain reactions including those in glycolysis as well as nitrogen, phosphate, and glucose transport () is not viable due to stoichiometric violations. When we plot yield versus production rate for the solutions obtained with fixed glucose, no off-diagonal solutions are observed (data not shown). Thus, in order to further explore possible ethylene yields, we continue to allow for flexibility in substrate uptake, and enforce only maximum uptake rates and a minimum growth rate.
