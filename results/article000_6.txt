To determine changes in the membrane integrity of  cells as a consequence of the method selected to concentrate the cells or due to the incubation of cells in different water types, fluorescence microscopy was used. For this, a 1:1 mixture of the following nucleic acid dyes was added to 1 ml of the samples: SYTO 9 as an indicator of viable bacteria and propidium iodide as an indicator of dead bacteria (LIVE/DEAD Light Bacterial Viability Kit, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). The suspensions were incubated in the dark for 10 min, followed by a 5-min centrifugation step at 3000 rpm. Microscopic evaluation was carried out using a Leica DMI6000CS confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) in combination with a HCX PL APO lambda blue 63.01.40 oil UV objective. Settings were adjusted in accordance with control preparations using heat-killed bacteria (15 min, 70C). A minimum of six randomly selected images were acquired per individual sample and used for quantification of green (live), red (dead), and orange (intermediate) bacteria. Experiments were carried out at three independent times.
