To assess whether LPS levels in the range of 0.11 EU are actually present in commercial recombinant proteins, we performed LAL assays on five commercially obtained recombinant proteins. As shown in , three proteins had a slightly higher endotoxin amount than stated in the data sheet. Of note, the measured endotoxin levels in recombinant protein 1, a product that was obtained from two different suppliers, were vastly different. Whereas the protein from supplier 2 had barely measurable endotoxin impurities (2 pg/g protein), the product from supplier 1 was contaminated with 140 pg of endotoxin per microgram of protein, somewhat higher than the maximum specified by the manufacturer (<1 EU or <100 pg). To confirm these endotoxin contaminations, recombinant protein 1 from both suppliers was once more tested by alternative endotoxin detection assays (EndoZyme and EndoLISA) along with increasing concentrations of LPS (). The two additional assays revealed detectable endotoxin contaminations for protein 1 from supplier 1, although the results provided by the three different assays (LAL, EndoZyme and EndoLISA) were not completely identical and ranged between 0.8 and 1.4 EU.
