Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis ,. As NF-B activates expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory enzymes, so inhibitors of NF-B are lead compounds for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs. The most common mechanism for NF-B inhibition is through prevention of IB- degradation . However, gentiolactone appeared to inhibit TNF- expression in a different manner. Identification of the molecular target of gentiolactone and characterization of the mechanism for blocking NF-B promoter activity will provide new insights for designing novel NF-B inhibitors.

The roots and rhizomes of  cv. September Blue were collected from the field of Iwate Biotechnology Research Center, Iwate, Japan, in June 2012, and were authenticated by Dr. Hideyuki Takahashi, Iwate Biotechnology Research Center. A voucher specimen (GR-Spb-120615) was deposited in the Iwate Biotechnology Research Center.
