Proteins involved in ion transport activate key components of the enzymatic antioxidant machinery, which is important for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining higher redox states in plant cells under high salinity . ROS production by plants is part of the general defense response against pathogenic microorganisms , . Expression of catalase in F4 is significantly induced in F4 after exposure to exogenous HO . Therefore, catalase may participate in the elimination of ROS produced by F4 infection in banana root. Peroxiredoxins, which can regulate HO levels to cause damage and/or affect signal transduction processes, play important roles in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways , . Several catalase-peroxidase isoforms were identified in our study, which may scavenge ROS as well as combine with other ion transporters to play important roles in the Fusarium-induced infection of banana wilt.
