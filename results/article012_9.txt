The  targeting vectors constructed and the gene targeting scheme are shown in . The vector construct was designed to produce a 27-base pair (bp) deletion in Exon 2 including open reading frame by homologous recombination as a result of the antibiotic resistance gene cassette. Therefore, translation is stopped approximately 1.3 kb downstream from the initiator codon, and truncated  proteins are produced. Transfected cells possessing a DNA fragment from the inserted vector region of the antibiotic resistance gene to the 3 short homologous arm region were amplified by PCR, whereas nontransfected cells were not. Nine of the 384 cell colonies obtained were PCR-positive for  heterozygous KO transfection. Among them, two colonies, #51-2 and #95-2, were successfully expanded and used for SCNT. Regarding  homozygous KO transfection, of the 288 colonies, 12 PCR-positive cell colonies were obtained, six of which were used for SCNT.
