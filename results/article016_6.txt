There are a number of software packages designed for the visualization and analysis of domain-general complex networks, such as Pajek  and Gephi . Notably, there are several software packages specially designed for visualization and analysis of the human connectome: the Connectome Viewer , the BrainNet Viewer , and the VisualConnectome toolbox (). Building on visualization features from these packages, we sought to provide new interactive features for the visualization of structural and functional connectivity, and make visualization a more interactive process.

Here, we introduce a general-purpose, free, and open source software package written in python specially designed for the visualization of multi-modal human brain networks: the Connectome Visualization Utility (CVU). CVU is a standalone application with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that automatically generates powerful, interactive visualizations of human brain networks from common matrix and imaging file formats. It is decoupled from the process of connectivity estimation and network creation, and can therefore be easily used to visualize networks from any imaging modality. CVU is designed with the visualization of complex graph theoretical properties in mind and allows network statistics to be easily incorporated into the visualization.
