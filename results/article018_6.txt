LPS 055:B5 was obtained from SigmaAldrich, Vienna, Austria. All proteins tested in this study are recombinant human cytokines and were obtained from three different suppliers, labelled supplier 1, 2 and 3. According to the manufacturers' data sheets, these recombinant proteins were routinely tested for endotoxin contamination by unspecified LAL tests. However, we do not disclose the names of the manufacturers or products in this study due to the proprietary nature of this information.
