Approximately 1200 g of protein was used to perform 2-DE with 24 cm, pH 47 linear gradient IPG strips (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) as described , . The gels were visualized with the by Coomassie brilliant blue G-250, ammonium sulfate and phosphoric acid (GAP) staining method as described . Gel images were statistically analyzed using ImageMaster 2D Platinum software (Version 5.0,GE Healthcare). Three representative gels from three corresponding biological replicates (n = 3) were used to determine the differential protein spots. The protein spots with p-value<0.05 and relative volume ratio 2.0 or 0.5 (two fold change) were deemed differential.
