Although the key elements in terms of SC were VSD diameter, ATVMS formation, and no associated complications, other factors, including initial contact age, diffuse shunt flow and increased LVDD also played roles. The significantly higher rate of SC in patients with initial contact age 1 year is consistent with most previous reports, which showed that the rate of SC is highest in the first year after birth. Diffuse shunt flow, which might reflect a hemodynamic change or a communication between the 2 ventricles, should also be considered as a factor associated with the outcome. Increased LVDD was a negative predictor for SC, which is consistent with previous studies suggesting that enlarging left ventricular size is an indication for surgical repair . However, pulmonary hypertension did not appear in our prediction model and scoring system, indicating that PH is not a prognostic factor but rather a manifestation of the clinical course in patients with VSD.
