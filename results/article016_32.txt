In this paper we have described the Connectome Visualization Utility, a free and open-source software package dedicated to the visualization of the human connectome. CVU offers three different complementary interactive visualizations that efficiently depict complex brain networks of any scale and modality, as well as an easy-to-use GUI, a host of well-documented visual customizations for interactive data exploration using graph statistics and modular structure, and interactive scripting that allows direct access to the data and can leverage the tools available in a scientific python environment. CVU uses transparent data formats, representing data as the user's choice of common file types such as MATLAB matrices, text files with matrix data, and FreeSurfer or GIFTI surfaces.
