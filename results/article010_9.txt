Differences in the dominant ions were found between the study area and the background sites. The NO concentration was similar to or even greater than the SO in the study area, compared higher concentration of SO than NO at the background sites. Cl and Ca concentrations were one order of magnitude greater than those of K and Na, while they were similar at the background sites. To give a broader picture, ion concentrations in PM of other important city in eastern Asian were shown in . The concentrations of NO and SO were similar between Beijing and Shanghai, while NO concentrations were higher in Beijing than in Guangzhou. SO concentrations were similar between the two cities. The three eastern Asia cities outside China had smaller equivalent ion concentrations.
