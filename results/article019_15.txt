5-Hydroxy-2-adamantanone () (1.8 g, 10 mmol) and S--methylbenzylamine (1.3 g, 10 mmol) were dissolved in absolute ethanol (50 mL) and refluxed for 64 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated obtaining yellow oil as the resulting imine 9 (2.8 g). It was used without further purification in the next step. LC-MS retention time 5.52 min [M+H]  = 270.
