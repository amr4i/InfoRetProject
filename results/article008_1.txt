A run chart is a simple line graph of a measure over time with the median shown as a horizontal line dividing the data points so that half of the points are above the median and half are below (). The main purpose of the run chart is to detect process improvement or process degradation, which will turn up as non-random patterns in the distribution of data points around the median.
