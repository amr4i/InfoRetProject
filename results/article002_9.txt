At the indicated time points, aliquots of each sample were diluted to OD = 0.01 into 200 L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 2 mg/mL kanamycin to halt translation. These dilutions were then further diluted 1:20 into 200 L of phosphate-buffered saline with 2 mg/mL kanamycin in 96-well plates. The GFP fluorophore was allowed to mature for 30 minutes following dilution of the final time point, and 10,000 events were collected for each sample on a Millipore Guava easyCyte 5HT flow cytometer. Gates were set around the cell population using the forward and side scatter channels, and average population fluorescence values were calculated using the geometric mean. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software ().
