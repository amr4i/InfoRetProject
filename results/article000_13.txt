Fluorescence microscopy was used to determine proportions of viable and nonviable cells after inoculation of  in pond or tap water. For this, water samples and control NaCl were spiked with approximately 5.010 CFU/ml  DSM 4688 and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Determination of the percentage of viable and dead cells revealed mean percentages of 50.18% viable and 46.73% nonviable cells in tap water; thus, these values were comparable to the results obtained in spiked NaCl samples (56.87% and 41.10%, respectively). No statistically significant differences (>0.05) could be detected between the media. In contrast, inoculation of cells in pond water revealed percentages of 13.82% viable and 81.59% nonviable cells (). The values of both parameters differed significantly (<0.05) from the results of the control (0.9% NaCl) samples. Deviations from 100% resulted from the proportions of intermediate cells.
