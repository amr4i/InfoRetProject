To reduce the complexity of visualizing high-dimensionality data, CVU provides three types of interactive, integrated visualizations: the  view, the  view, and the  view. These three visualizations are designed to offer complementary overviews of the same data, so as to maximize the amount of information that can be accrued at a glance. The views are linked, and update simultaneously when the data changes. The complexity of the data is further reduced by a number of interactive features, which can further expand the number of possible views by isolating certain connections or by rotating the 3D brain. The three main views are presented directly to the user when the program is launched or when new connectivity data is supplied, with no intermediate scripting necessary. If the user launches the program without specifying any data, a sample dataset showing MEG synchronization likelihood connectivity  from one subject is loaded automatically. The GUI, as it appears immediately upon launching the program with no data, is shown in .
