Plasma transport with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes or plasma preparation tubes (PPT) is the gold standard for VL testing. However, generating plasma samples requires trained phlebotomists and electricity in health posts to power the centrifuges. Current recommendations for plasma storage and transport require that plasma is transported within 24 hours at 25C in EDTA tubes, or within 5 days at 4C for EDTA tubes or PPT, after centrifugation () . If there is no access to centrifugation, whole blood in EDTA tubes or PPT cannot be stored more than 6 hours at 25C. The logistical constraints, coupled with overall expense, make this option challenging to implement in resource-limited settings. Although phlebotomists are still required for venous blood sampling, whole blood transport relieves the need of electricity for centrifugation in health posts  a requirement 30% of health posts in Sub-Saharan Africa lack  as well as potential transcription errors, and safety and contamination risks, associated with plasma processing .
