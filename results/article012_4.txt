The preparation of  KO cells was performed as previously described . Original porcine fetal fibroblasts (PFF: T6-12) were isolated from a wild-type Duroc male fetus and cultured in minimum essential medium- containing 10% fetal calf serum (10% FCS-MEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 38.5C in 5% CO. Transfection of the  heterozygous KO vectors was performed by electroporation. PFFs (110) were transfected with 5 g of the  heterozygous KO vector at 220 V and 950 F using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Transfected cells were cultured in 10% FCS-MEM in a 6-well plate for 48 h. After incubation, the transfected cells were suspended with 400 g/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 20 M gancyclovir (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) for positivenegative selection. For the preparation of the  homozygous KO cells,  heterozygous KO porcine fetal fibroblasts ( PFF) were isolated from a  heterozygous Duroc male fetus produced by nuclear transfer. These cells were then transfected with the  homozygous KO vector using the method described above. For the selection of homozygous KO cells, 10 g/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added to the heterozygous KO selection method. After being cultured for 10 days, each cell colony was separated into two parts and then continuously cultured. After from 24 h to 48 h culture, one of the two-division cells was isolated and used for PCR analysis . Positive KO cells were grown to confluence in a 75 cm flask and cryopreserved until SCNT.
