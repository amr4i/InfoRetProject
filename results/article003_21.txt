As our primary interest in this study was to identify virulence-related proteins, we performed further in-depth analysis of the 46 proteins form F4 ( and ). Several of these proteins had more than three isoforms, including catalase-peroxidase, galactosidase, glucanosyltransferase, phosphoglycerate kinase and ATP synthase. TargetP analysis predicted that 18 proteins are in the secretary pathway, 5 localize to mitochondria, 14 are in other locations and 10 have no known locations. Compared to TargetP, GO-cellular component analysis produced very limited location information ().
