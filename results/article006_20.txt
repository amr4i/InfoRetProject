Age at initial contact, VSD diameter, diffuse shunt flow, ATVMS formation, increased LVDD and associated complications can be independent predictors of spontaneous PMVSD closure. Outcome can be estimated by our new scoring system, using these independent predictors, and such scoring of PMVSD patients may facilitate appropriate planning by pediatricians.
