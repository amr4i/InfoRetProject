After filtration or centrifugation of the spiked water samples, EMA treatment was carried out as previously described for the detection of  from poultry products . In brief, the intercalating dye EMA (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to samples at a final concentration of 10 g/ml. After a 15-min incubation in the dark, tubes were placed in an ice-cooled box and subjected to photoactivation for 15 min using a 500-W halogen lamp source (dwi type R7s, REV Ritter GmbH, Mmbris, Germany). DNA was extracted from 1 ml of EMA-treated or untreated samples using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The qPCR was performed with the SureFood PATHOGEN  PLUS LC kit (Congen, Berlin, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The detection limit for this kit is less than or equal to five copies/sample. PCR conditions were 60 s at 95C, followed by 45 cycles of 95C for 10 s and 60C for 15 s. For qPCR analysis, a LightCycler 480 II instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was used. For EMA-qPCR experiments, an internal standard of EMA-pretreated cells was used along with an adapted standard curve to compensate for the C shift caused by the pretreatment of cells with the intercalating dye . All experiments were carried out three times.
