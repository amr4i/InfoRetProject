Complex networks are described by quantitative graph theoretical properties. To characterize these networks, various network statistics are computed, such as the clustering coefficient , local efficiency , centrality , , and modularity , . CVU natively calculates and displays a range of weighted and binary, nodal and global network statistics. These measures can then be displayed topographically on the network, affording an overview of statistical patterns throughout the whole brain at a glance. Statistics computed by CVU can also be saved to disk as common matrix file formats. Any scalar metrics which CVU does not calculate natively can additionally be imported and displayed inside the program.
