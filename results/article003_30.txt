Among the F4-specific proteins, catalase-peroxidase (KatG) is a unique bifunctional oxidoreductase with peroxidatic and catalatic activities within a single active site , . KatG can be secreted out of fungal cells to perform distinct functions . Extracellular KatG is exclusively found in phytopathogenic fungi . In the rice blast fungus , KatG protects the pathogen from the increased level of HO in rice epidermal cells at the early stage of infection . Secretion KatG, as well as another catalase, is important for both hyphal growth and maintenance of the integrity of the fungal cell wall . In , KatG protectes the fungus from the oxidative response of host plants at advanced stages of the disease . In our present study, we identified several protein spots as catalase-peroxidase, one of them being more abundant in F4 than in F1, and the others were specially detected only in F4 (), indicating that this enzyme might be key in the virulence of .
