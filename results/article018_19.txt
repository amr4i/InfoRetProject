The present study aimed at investigating the effects of very low LPS concentrations on human immune cells. We show that CD1c dendritic cells especially can be activated by minimal amounts of LPS, equivalent to the levels of endotoxin contamination we detected in some commercially available proteins. THP-1 cells were the least sensitive cell type, which might be explained by the fact that they represent a relatively immature type in the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage that expresses low levels of CD14 . As CD14-deficient monocytes are characterised by poor LPS uptake , low CD14 expression in THP-1 cells could result in reduced sensitivity to LPS. Although CD14 monocytes have been used as precursors for the generation of moDCs, the latter have a typical DC-like morphology. moDCs express high levels of CD1a but lack CD14 , which may again account for the lower LPS sensitivity of these cells compared to monocytes. Interestingly, CD1c DCs are classified as myeloid DCs, the majority of which are CD14 . Yet, a minor fraction of these cells was previously described to express CD14 , . In the present study we clearly show that CD1c DCs maintained in cell culture medium for 24 hours express increased levels of CD14. CD14 was shown to bind LPS at picomolar concentrations and to be critically involved in controlling endotoxin sensitivity especially to low concentrations of LPS , . We therefore assume that the high CD14 expression on CD1c DCs observed after 24 hours of culturing significantly contributes to the enhanced sensitivity of these cells and allows for LPS-induced cytokine secretion and surface marker expression, despite the fact that TLR4 expression is rather low in those cells. However, besides CD14, other proteins as well, including LPS-binding protein, the secreted glycoprotein MD-2 and a number of adaptor proteins, contribute to LPS binding and LPS-induced signal transduction  and may thus be important candidates for further investigation.
