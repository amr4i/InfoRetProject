Our results indicated that CFS-1686 might interact with top1 prior to the top1-DNA complex formation. We localized the interaction sites of Top1 and CFS-1686 by first defining several possible docking sites in the interface of top1 and DNA substrate. The LigandFit module located several possible docking sites in this region (). Except for sites 1 to 3, most docking sites were too shallow to accommodate the compounds and therefore they were excluded. Sites 2 and 3 were so bulky that when the DNA substrate was superposed back to the pseudo open state of Top1, a compound docked at these sites might not interfere with the incoming DNA substrate. Consequently, site 1 was the best choice for the docking simulation. Site 1 is also adjacent to Tyr723, whose phosphorylation is greatly involved in cleavage of the 3-phosphotyrosine ester bond of the DNA substrate , . This further supports our choice of docking site.
