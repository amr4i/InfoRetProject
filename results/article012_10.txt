heterozygous KO donor cells (#95-2) obtained from the original PFF (T6-12) by gene targeting were used for SCNT (: Step 1). The reconstructed embryos were cultured in PZM-3 medium for 2 days. Day 2 reconstructed embryos were transferred to one recipient gilt, and the pregnant gilt was used to obtain a  heterozygous KO fetus for the generation of  homozygous KO cells at a gestation of 33 days (  PFF). Next  homozygous KO donor cells (#3-55), derived from  heterozygous KO PFF by homologous recombination, were used to obtain  homozygous KO fetal fibroblast cells (: Step 2). The  homozygous KO fetal fibroblast cells generated were used to produce -deficient newborn piglets (  PFF). A total of 526 reconstructed Day 1 and 2 embryos were mixed and transferred into four recipient gilts (: Step 3). Pregnancy was confirmed in three recipients using an ultrasound scanner at 2628 days after embryo transfer. Eventually, two pregnant sows delivered two piglets by cesarean section.
