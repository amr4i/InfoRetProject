Cells were harvested by incubating in a lysis buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP40), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor cocktail pellet (Roche Molecular Biochemical, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail pellet (Roche)] for 10 min at 4C. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. An equal amount of protein per sample was loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and transferred for 2 h at 100 V onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat milk, then incubated overnight at 4C with rabbit anti-human FOXO1 (1:1000; sc-11350) or rabbit anti-human GAPDH (1:3000; sc-25778). Blots were then incubated with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and bands were visualized using the SuperSignal West Dura Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).
