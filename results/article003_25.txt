It is assumed that the pathogenicity of fungi is controlled by multiple proteins. Hence identification of the virulence-related proteins is of great significant importance for uncovering the pathogenic mechanisms. It is also likely that proteins differentially represented in F1 and F4 account for the different pathogenicity of the two races. The virulence proteins that have been characterized from F1 and F4 are involved in signal transduction, transcription, defense system, and colonization . They include G-proteins , mitogen-activated protein kinase , signal transcription factor , , glucosidase , polygalacturonase , and mitochondrial carrier protein . Proteomics studies in  ,  and  ,  identified 174 cell wall proteins and 19 proteins carrying predicted signal peptides in , including glucose-regulated protein, acid phosphatase, cell wall glucanosyltransferase, glucanase, secreted aspartic protease, and vacuolar protease . These studies also identified 197 proteins in  MSA 35 that were involve in virulence and/or antagonism other fungi, and some of which may affect the fitness of defense mechanisms .
