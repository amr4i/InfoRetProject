Because of the pivotal role of thermoTRP channels in pain transduction , we hypothesized that the analgesic activity of compound  may be due to a direct inhibition of some these channels. Among the thermoTRPs, TRPM8 (melastatin), TRPV1 (vanilloid) and TRPA1 (ankyrin) are the most validated in pain signaling. TRPV1 is considered a molecular integrator of noxious heat stimuli in nociceptors , TRPM8 is a pivotal sensor for cold stimuli, and TRPA1 is a unique sensor of noxious environmental stimuli . Therefore, we selected these channels to evaluate if any of them was the target of compound  ().
