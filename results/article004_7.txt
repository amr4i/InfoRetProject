To screen the specific CYP isoform responsible for the MH metabolism, we determined the inhibitory effect of specific inhibitors on the metabolism of MH in the HLMs. Inhibitors including furafylline (FUR, inhibitor for CYP1A2), trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine (TRA, for CYP2A6, 1 M), sulfaphenazole (SUL, for CYP2C9, 1 M), quinidine (QUI, for CYP2D6, 1 M), chlormethiazole (CHL, for CYP2E1, 5 M), ticlopidine (TIC, for CYP2C19, 1 M) and ketoconazole (KET, for CYP3A4, 1 M) were separately incubated with MH (10 M), the HLMs and NADPH under the same incubation conditions as mentioned above. The concentrations of the inhibitors used were approximately at their respective  values from previous reports . The inhibitory effects of the above specific inhibitors on the metabolic clearance rate of MH were evaluated separately to screen the CYP isoforms responsible for the MH metabolism. The relative activity of the CYP isoforms was calculated by dividing the peak area of MH when incubated with the inhibitor with that of MH from the negative controls.
