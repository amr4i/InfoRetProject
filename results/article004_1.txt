Common antidepressants were discontinued because they inhibited gastrointestinal kinetics , . In contrast, meranzin hydrate (MH), an absorbed bioactive compound originating from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS) , , was considered a prospective candidate to treat depression because of its gastrointestinal prokinetic properties . Xie  reported that MH could increase the amplitude of contractility in the longitudinal and circular jejunum muscles in a dose-dependent manner , . Furthermore, Huang  reported that MH significantly accelerated the gastric emptying and intestinal transit in rats . Therefore, MH was considered to be a prospective antidepressant better than other antidepressants.
