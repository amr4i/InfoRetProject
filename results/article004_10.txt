To determine the major enzymes responsible for MH metabolism in HLMs, the metabolic clearance rate of the incubation solution without any specific inhibitor for MH was considered as 100%. The effects of the specific inhibitors on the metabolic clearance rate of MH were evaluated with SPSS one-way analysis of variance (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P<0.05 denoted significance in all cases. The apparent kinetic parameters of MH ( and ) were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program GraphPad Prism Enzyme Kinetic 5 Demo (GraphPad Co. Ltd, San Diego, CA, USA). The equation was expressed as .  is the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is 50% of . To determine the inhibition of CYP isoforms, the activity of each CYP isoform was calculated using the metabolic clearance rate of its corresponding probe substrate. The metabolic clearance rate of the probe substrate was considered to be 100% when no specific inhibitor and MH were added in the incubation assay. The  were determined by analyzing the plot of the logarithm of the inhibitor concentration versus the percentage of activity remaining after inhibition, using the SPSS software for Windows (version 11.5, SPSS, Chicago, IL). To calculate the  values, the inhibition data were fit to different models of enzyme inhibition (competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive) by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Co. Ltd).
