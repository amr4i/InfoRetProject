Carbohydrates in form of nectar sugars constitute the main energy source for adult bees , . Most bees ingest nectar by lapping, with the maximal energy intake rate being achieved for sugar concentrations of around 5060% , . Lower and higher concentrations can be imbibed as well, and it has been shown in honey bees that nectar throughput through the proventriculus is adjusted to the nectar sugar concentration and the metabolic rate, with lower concentrations receiving a relatively higher throughput and vice versa . Though this mechanism ensures a consistent energy supply independent of the concentrations of imbibed solutions, honey bees and other bees usually prefer the higher concentrated nectar if given a choice (honey bees ; euglossine bees ; bumble bees ). A high sugar to water ratio of crop content means that the carried weight has more energetic value, which would allow the bees to remain active and airborne for longer periods of time without having to refuel at nectar sources. This could be especially beneficial for activities that require high energy expenditure (flying/hovering) over reasonably long periods of time, when either access to flowers is not possible, or the time is required for other behaviors (discussed in e.g. ) This can be envisioned to apply in the context of mate-finding, e.g. during mating flights in carpenter bees  or bumble bees , where males stay airborne for long periods of time, or when defending a territory (see  ). Other situations in which bees should benefit from energetically rich crop contents are fast long range movements and when female bees forage for pollen at plants that do not provide nectar (see ).
