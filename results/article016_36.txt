CVU is decoupled from any choice of parcellation, and thus is easily adaptable to a variety of parcellation schemes. CVU is able to represent parcellations defined as a collection of surface labels or as structures defined in a volume. It is also possible to represent the parcellation simply as a matrix file specifying 3-dimensional coordinates (e.g., EEG electrodes), optionally providing an additional registration matrix to orient these coordinates to the surface. Parcellations can be specified as any of multiple common file formats  surface-based parcellations may be represented with FreeSurfer or GIFTI annotation files, while volumetric parcellations can be specified with virtually any image format.
