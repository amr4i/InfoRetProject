Since the FOXO1 repression mapped to the 304/95 region of the  promoter and required the FOXO1 DBD, we performed EMSA to determine whether FOXO1 could bind to this part of the promoter . Seven 35-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed to span the 304/95 region. Flag-FOXO1-CA, synthesized with TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate, bound to an oligonucleotide probe containing a consensus FBE (, lane 1). To identify which complex contained the Flag-FOXO1-CA bound to the FBE, we supershifted the complex with a Flag antibody (, lane 3) but not with control IgG (, lane 2). Incubation with an oligo encompassing the 125/91 region of the  promoter also resulted in the formation of a barely detectable protein-DNA complex that was clearly shifted with a Flag antibody but not IgG (, lanes 2224) while incubation with oligos encompassing the 305/121 regions did not result in detectable FOXO1 binding (, lanes 421). These results suggest that, in contrast to the consensus FBE, FOXO1 can bind weakly to the 125/91 region of the murine  promoter.
