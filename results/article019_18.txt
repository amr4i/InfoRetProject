The animals, CD-1 male mice (2527 g), were redistributed in groups, two of which were used as the control group. The remaining twelve groups were treated with paracetamol 100 and 200 mg/kg (two different groups), compound 5 (100, 200, 500 mg/kg) and compound 6a/b (250, 375, 500, 750 mg/kg). An additional group received morphine 5 mg/kg. All drugs were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered, 30 minutes before the algogen agent. Control mice were treated with 10 ml/kg of saline solution. Each group included 1012 animals; those animals showing behavioral alterations were previously discarded. Each animal was used only once. An observer who was unaware of the different treatments carried out the collection of data.

The experimental test used was the acetic acid writhing test. The effect of the i.p. administration of 10 ml/kg of acetic acid (2%) was measured by quantifying the number of writhing responses in the three groups of animals over a 10 minutes period. Responses were measured starting 5 minutes after the algogen agent was administered. The animals used were supplied by the animal house of Universidad Rey Juan Carlos. Room temperature was kept at 221C. A 12 hours light - dark cycle was started at 8:00 a.m., at constant humidity. All animals were given free access to food and water.
