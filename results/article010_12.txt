Correlations between the anion and cation equivalents were observed (). Ion balance calculations stratified by season showed that summer and autumn samples were above the A/C (anion/cation) unity line in both PM and PM, indicating that anion was excessive. In contrast, the spring anion was insufficient; i.e., below the A/C unity line. In winter, the ion balance relationships were inconsistent between PM samples and PM samples, indicating that the sources of PM and PM were different in winter. Higher regression slopes were found in PM samples. The reason might be the precursors of SO and NO, which enriched primarily in the small particulate matter. A steeper slope was observed in summer primarily because SO and NO were more easily oxidized to HSO and HNO and accumulated in the aerosols under the intensive illumination and high temperature . A/C also varied by size and site location. Annual A/C ratios of PM in Beijing and in Shijiazhuang were smaller than 0.9, but larger than 1.1 in Tianjin. When coming to the PM, Beijing and Tianjin were very close to 1.0. These results demonstrate that anions tend to be distributed in small particles.
