The catch-abilities of trap nets varied from the order of magnitude 10 in Finland to 10 in Estonia. However, in all other surveyed areas except F2 the catchability was with 95% probability greater than 10. The catchability in sub-area F2 was with 95% under 310 and, thus, this sub-area differed substantially from other sub-areas. The posterior predictive distribution of trap net catchability in sub-areas F3, S1 and S3, from where we did not have interview information on them, was concentrated near zero with median 310 and a heavy right tail (). The high variance in these distributions was due to high variability in catch-abilities between sub-areas with observations. The uncertainty in catchability was the smallest in S2, where almost all fishermen were interviewed.
