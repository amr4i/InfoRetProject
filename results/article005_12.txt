Reactions that are inactive in the baseline solution (corresponding to zero flux through the reaction) are excluded from modifications, and allowed to vary between the original upper (v) and lower bounds (-v) for Constrictor FBA optimizations. The biomass, glucose uptake, oxygen uptake, and ATP maintenance reactions are also excluded from Constrictor modifications. The resultant FBA linear programming problem is solved to obtain the globally optimal solution for ethylene production for each of the  expression states, where each column ( = 1 through ) is iteratively selected as the flux boundaries ().
