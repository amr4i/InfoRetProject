To assess these two possibilities, we tested whether FOXO1 could bind to the region of the  promoter necessary for the repressive effect. Gel-shift assays demonstrated that  transcribed and translated FOXO1 bound to the 125/91 region of the  promoter, albeit much more weakly than FOXO1 binding to a consensus FBE (). Interestingly, the 125/91 region contains a composite binding element for SMAD and FOXL2 proteins which has been shown to be essential for activin induction , , . We did not observe binding of FOXO1 to this region of the promoter when LT2 nuclear extracts were used instead of TnT FOXO1. Our studies are in agreement with a recent report by Choi  which demonstrated that FOXO1 can bind to the  promoter using a DNA pulldown assay but was not detectable in a gel-shift assay employing LT2 nuclear extracts . Thus, these studies indicate that FOXO1 binding to the  promoter may be a potential mechanism of FOXO1 repression of activin signaling in gonadotropes.
