Our system has good discriminatory ability, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.83 and it is possible to group patients according to their scores in high-probability, intermediate-probability and low-probability in both the derivation and the validation cohort. Patients predicted to have a low probability have the poorest prognosis and have to be managed surgically as early as possible to avoid severe CHF. Patients predicted to have an intermediate probability could be managed operatively with elective procedures and their parents could be informed appropriately; thereby allowing them to prepare mentally and financially. For patients who are predicted to have a high probability, close follow-up by a pediatrician is recommended, in order to reduce parental anxiety.
