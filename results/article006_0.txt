Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most frequently diagnosed congenital heart defect, with a reported overall incidence of 17.3 cases per 1000 births in China . Depending on the follow-up period and type of perimembranous ventricular septal defect (PMVSD), the rate of spontaneous closure (SC) varies between 6% and 50% . Although defect size , defect location , the presence of aneurysmal tissue of the ventricular membranous septum (ATVMS)  and associated complications , ,  have been identified as factors for predicting spontaneous PMVSD closure, there is no scoring system that takes all of these factors with their various degrees into account for predicting the outcome of PMVSD. Previous models for forecasting SC probability and necessary VSD surgery were derived from indexed VSD cross-sectional area determinations and in a small group of patients . In our study, we sought to develop a new scoring system for predicting spontaneous PMVSD probability and examine its validity.
