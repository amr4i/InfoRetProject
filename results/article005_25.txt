So far, improvements in ethylene production by selectively repressing metabolic activity have not yet been reported. Experimental attempts to engineer ethylene-producing microorganisms have included increasing media concentration, increasing gene copy number, inserting codon-optimized  sequences, testing different promoters to drive  expression, and reducing homologous recombination between  promoter and chromosome , , , . Flux balance analysis has not yet been applied to optimize ethylene production in . In the ethylene-producing networks described here, we focused on modifying only flux through the metabolic reactions initially present in the network, and did not attempt to substitute enzymes with different cofactors or force alternate substrates as has been suggested via computational analysis to optimize ethylene production in other organisms , . Therefore, the mutants presented here could provide novel strategies to modify  metabolism for ethylene production.
