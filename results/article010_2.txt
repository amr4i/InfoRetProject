To compare the levels of the particulates and water-soluble ions in three cities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang) and four national atmospheric background sites, PM and PM samples were collected simultaneously at the seven sites in each season during 2013. Sampling locations of 3 studied cities were at the downtown area, while the background sampling sites were at remote rural area. Meanwhile samples from a control site at Datong city, which is close to the study area, were also collected. The field studies were carried out in the monitoring stations controlled or supervised by the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre (CNEMC). CNEMC has authority to permit our access to each station. Our field studies only collected atmospheric samples, which did not involve any endangered or protected species. The sampling sites are summarized in . Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang are located at the northwestern edge of the Great North China Plain, surrounded by mountains in all directions, except the south. The mountains extend several hundred kilometers and the highest peak is greater than 3000 m in elevation. The considerable emission of air pollutants in the region produces a high concentration of atmospheric particles.
