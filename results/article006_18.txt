In the validation group, particularly for patients with intermediate probability, the observed SC rate was lower than estimated. First, the follow-up period was much shorter in the validation cohort, as the start time was January 2010. Second, with the rapid development of sophisticated techniques, more parents agreed to operations for small traumata with low risk and fewer post-operative complications, rather than to wait for a natural closure of the defect in their children. It is important to note the possibility of overcorrecting PMVSD by surgery or intervention, since a group of patients with intermediate probability of SC could avoid operative management. Although the scoring system at different times on the vertical comparison had certain differences, the SC rate of PMVSD was still higher, with higher scores during the same period in the horizontal comparison.
