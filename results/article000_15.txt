As the results indicated a general applicability of EMA-qPCR, this method was used for analysis of spiked pond water, rain water, and mineral water samples. Similar to results from tap water samples, the results from rain water and mineral water samples were in good accordance (R = 0.929; slope, 0.951 and R = 0.989; slope, 1.013, respectively) with the reference method (). Results from Bland-Altman plots also showed low variations between the methods. For rain water samples, the mean difference was 0.1380.439 (SD) log CFU and the 95% limit of agreement was 0.998 to 0.722 CFU (log), whereas for mineral water samples, the mean difference in log CFU was 0.1530.171 (SD) with upper and lower limits of 0.488 to 0.183 CFU (log) (). However, when pond water was used, no correlation (R = 0.0005; slope, 0.0143) between results from real-time PCR signals and the reference method could be detected () and a low level of agreement was confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis (mean difference of 1.1191.166 SD, 95% limits of agreement were 3.405 and 1.166, respectively).
