The size of the particulate matter affected its capability for ionic enrichment. The total mass concentration of the dominant ions contained in PM was about 60%-90% of the mass concentration of the dominant ions contained in PM (See ). That is, more ions were distributed in the fine particle (PM) than that in the coarse particle (PMPM). The enrichment of non-dominant ions displayed more complex relationships. In spring and summer, ~50 80% of F was found in PM at each site, while in autumn and winter the proportion dropped to 1737%. The Na and K distributions were similar to those of the dominant ions, with an annual range of 5996%, with the exception of Na, which was present at a concentration of 43% in summer in Beijing. Greater complexity was displayed by the Ca and Mg distributions, both seasonally and spatially. <30% Ca and <50% Mg were found in PM in Beijing. That is, the source of Ca and Mg in Beijing was primarily large particles. High proportions of Ca and Mg in PM in spring and summer (~49 90%), and low proportions in autumn and winter (<25%) were found in Tianjin. The proportion of Ca in PM in Shijiazhuang decreased from 55% in spring to 25% in winter. The proportion of Mg in PM peaked in summer at ~70%, and decreased to 23% in winter. Hence, the source of non-dominant ions might vary from site to site.
