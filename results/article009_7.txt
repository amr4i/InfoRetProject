has been reported to be broadly expressed ( ZDB-IMAGE-050809-54; ). To confirm whether  is globally expressed and not in a tissue specific manner, we analyzed its expression throughout embryonic and early larval stages.  mRNA was already detected at 4-cell stage (). Since transcription from the zebrafish zygotic genome starts only at midblastula transition (MBT), shortly after 3 hpf , this reveals maternally transcribed  mRNA deposited into the oocyte. Therefore functional maternal mRNA derived Cnot8 protein is likely to enable proper development at early gastrula stages in  mutant embryos. During later embryonic and early larval stages  was ubiquitously expressed (; insets show sense control WISH).
