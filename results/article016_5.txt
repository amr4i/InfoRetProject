In order to map the human connectome, sophisticated visualization and analysis tools are required. A wide variety of free and open source software packages for the analysis of neuroimaging connectivity data are readily available. Most software packages currently available are integrated brain network tools that are designed for processing a single imaging modality Such packages include Camino , MNE , , dipy , Brainstorm , the Connectome Mapper , the MR Connectome Analysis Pipeline  and many other unpublished packages. As these packages are typically specialized for processing a particular modality, they have only limited visualization features, and are not necessarily designed to analyze multi-modal data.
