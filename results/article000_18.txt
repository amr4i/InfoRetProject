In this study, we investigated two factors (the method to recover cells and the type of water sample) that may influence the membrane integrity of cells, with the aim to investigate the applicability of a  EMA-qPCR approach for water analysis. First, two methods to concentrate  from water samples were comparatively analysed. In samples spiked with high amounts of , both methods led to a mean cell loss of approximately 1 log CFU/ml. This loss may be attributed to the incomplete retention of the pathogen on microfilters due to its small size and morphology, as previously proposed , or to a loss of cells when discarding the supernatant after the centrifugation of samples . In qPCR experiments, recovery rates may be enhanced by the use of a specific elution buffer containing 3% beef extract and a higher pH (pH = 9.0) . However, the use of this modified buffer seems to be inappropriate for a bacterial viability assessment, as survival rates of  decreased rapidly .
