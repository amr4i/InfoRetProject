Similarly, mutant B also has a lower ethanol yield than the baseline (albeit the decrease is only 2.5%), again due to reduced NADH production by GAPD. In mutant B, as opposed to mutant A, we note that limiting GAPD or PGK causes a portion of the upstream flux to divert through the pentose phosphate pathway (G6PDH2r, PGL, GND, RPE, RPI, TKT1, TALA, and TKT2). By this mechanism, some carbon dioxide is released via phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (GND), which reduces the amount of carbon that passes through GAPD or PGK and allows the Constrictor constraint to be satisfied. Additionally, the pentose phosphate pathway produces NADPH, which is used by glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUDy) and N-acetylglutamylphosphate reductase (AGPR) to synthesize precursors of L-arginine. We note that flux decreases through the NAD(P) transhydrogenase (THD2), presumably because the NADPH produced by G6PDHyr and GND is sufficient to meet the NADPH requirement of the L-arginine biosynthesis pathway. Increases in ATP synthase (ATPS4r), cytochrome oxidase (CYTBD), and NADH16 flux for both mutants A and B show that additional cofactors also influence ethylene production in a non-intuitive manner, likely related to oxygen deficiency. Certain expression states are not able to be solved, pointing to bottlenecks in the network. For instance, neither a 20% or 80% reduction in phosphate uptake or ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) activity is tolerated, nor is an 80% reduction in nitrogen or glucose uptake ().
