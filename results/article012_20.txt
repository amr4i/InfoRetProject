Animals with SCID are a versatile model for laboratory, translational, and biomedical research. Furthermore, they may represent a platform for the development of humanized animals and the assessment of pluripotent stem cells. Although rodent models are widely used, human-scale models and long-term testing are still required to bridge the gap between animal models and humans. In this study, our findings provide additional evidence that the  gene is essential for lymphocyte development in pigs, which is similar in rodents and humans, and we confirmed that -deficient pigs display a T-B-SCID phenotype with no leaks. Therefore,  KO pigs represent a promising model and provide important research resources that are similar to those described in recent reports. Future studies are required to confirm their utility as well as the fundamental characteristics of the phenotypic, immunologic, and morphologic changes in other breed and growth process.
