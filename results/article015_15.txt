The expected proportion of seals in each sub-area was the mean of the minimum and maximum estimates (). The scale parameter of the Dirichlet distribution was chosen so that approximately 90% of the prior probability mass was between the minimum and maximum estimates in the case of sub-area with the highest proportion (sub-area F2). Since, due to the properties of Dirichlet distribution, the variance relative to mean is greater for smaller proportions only about 60% of prior probability mass is within min/max values in the case of sub-areas with an expected proportion less than 10%. Given the total number of seals and the proportion of seals in sub-areas, the average number of seals in them was assumed to follow multinomial distribution. This led to Dirichlet Multinomial prior for the average number of seals in sub-areas

, where  denotes the vector of prior expectation of proportions () and the scale  governs the uncertainty about the expected value.

The catchability of a gear depends on many things, such as the specific type of gear and the fish species it targets. However, despite the evident variability in sub-area specific catchabilities they are still related. This was modelled by giving a hierarchical prior  for the scaled catchabilities. For computational reasons we implemented the model by down-scaling the effort by 10 but all the results are reported in the original scale. The prior for the catchabilities was
