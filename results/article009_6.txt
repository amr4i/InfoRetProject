To identify the gene affected by the  mutation, we mapped it using bulked segregant analysis and Simple Sequence Length Polymorphism (SSLP) genetic markers , and identified linkage to chromosome 21. Fine mapping of the  mutation required the generation of additional SSLP markers based on published sequence (Materials and Methods). The  critical genetic interval was defined by the proximal marker CR855270.17 p9 (genetic distance of 0.2 cM) and the distal marker BX927237 p4 (genetic distance of 0.07 cM) (). At the approximate position of 38.7 Mb of the linkage group 21 (assembly Zv8; ), we identified  and other adjacent genes as candidate genes for the  mutation. The sequencing of cDNA from homozygous mutant  larvae identified a base change at bp 82 within the  ORF, which resulted in changing an arginine codon to a stop codon, causing premature termination of the peptide after 27 amino acids. This result was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of the corresponding genomic DNA from  mutant and wild-type sibling larvae (). The zebrafish Cnot8 protein consists of 286 amino acids and has one predicted functional domain which exerts exonuclease activity and comprises amino acids 13 to 240 (). The premature stop codon causes the formation of a truncated Cnot8 peptide which lacks most of its RNAse domain and should lack its poly (A) deadenylation function. Thus, the  allele is expected to represent a complete loss of function or null allele of .
