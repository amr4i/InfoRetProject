Ethylene biosynthesis utilizing the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE) from  has been studied in a number of organisms, including  ,  ,  , ,  , and  , , . The ethylene forming enzyme from  catalyzes a reaction between L-arginine, 2-oxoglutarate, and oxygen to form ethylene, carbon dioxide, succinate, guanidine, and (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) . In yeast, the highest ethylene yield is reported to be 0.01 mol ethylene/mol glucose, which is approximately 1% of the theoretical maximum yield, reported as ranging between 0.73 and 0.87 mol ethylene/mol glucose . Engineered  strains have been shown to produce 0.14 mol ethylene/mol glucose at a production rate of 2.86 mmol/gdcw/hr, which is the highest reported yield and production rate for ethylene in any microbial host , . In , the maximum reported ethylene production rate is 0.008 mmol/gdcw/hr, which is less than 1% of the production rate in  . We choose  as the ethylene production host for the model, as  represents a common bacterial production strain with a simple metabolic network, and low ethylene production in  indicates the potential for optimization. Here, modifications to  metabolism are combinatorially analyzed using Constrictor, with the goal of revealing gene repressions that can inform experimental efforts and improve bioethylene yields as well as yields of alternate products.
