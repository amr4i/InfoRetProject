Since FOXO1 binding to the 125/95 region of the  promoter was weak compared to FOXO1 binding to the consensus FBE, we investigated whether FOXO1 physically interacts with SMAD proteins. We tested whether FOXO1 or DNA-binding deficient FOXO1 interacts with SMADs by incubating GST-SMAD2/3/4 fusion proteins with -transcribed and translated S-labeled FOXO1, FOXO1-CA or a FOXO1-CA-DBD mutant in pull-down experiments. As shown in , there was minimal interaction between the GST-SMAD fusion proteins and the negative control (S-GFP) or with GST alone incubated with FOXO1, FOXO1-CA or the FOXO1-CA-DBD mutant. In contrast, there was a strong interaction between FOXO1 and SMAD3 or SMAD4 which was not observed between FOXO1 and SMAD2. Additionally, a strong interaction was also observed between FOXO1-CA and SMAD3 or SMAD4 while there was no detectable interaction between the FOXO1-CA-DBD mutant and SMAD3 or SMAD4, indicating that the interaction between FOXO1 and SMAD3/4 requires the FOXO1 DBD.

Given our results demonstrating a direct protein-protein interaction between FOXO1 and SMAD3/4 , we then determined whether endogenous FOXO1 could interact with these proteins in gonadotrope cells using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in , SMAD4 and SMAD2/3 were efficiently immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts obtained from activin-treated or untreated LT2 cells. Since SMAD4 has been previously shown to interact with SMAD2/3 , SMAD2/3 co-immunoprecipitated with SMAD4 or  were used as positive controls and occurred in cells treated with activin. Interestingly, FOXO1 was also co-immunoprecipitated with SMAD4 or SMAD2/3 in an activin-dependent manner, indicating that endogenous FOXO1 can interact with SMAD3 and SMAD4 in gonadotropes.
