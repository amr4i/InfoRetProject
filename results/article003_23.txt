Comparison of the transcript accumulation and protein abundance in F1 and F4 can broaden our understanding of the roles of particular proteins on the induction of banana Fusarium wilt. To further evaluate the correlation between the abundance of the identified proteins and the expression of their corresponding genes, mRNAs encoding 15 proteins were selected for RT-PCR analysis. This subset included 13 F4-specific proteins or proteins that were more abundant in F4: galactosidase (spot 80), chitinase 1 (spot 79), glutathione reductase (spot 20), oxidoreductase (spot 62), glutamine amidotransferase (spot 2), adenosine kinase (spot 3), vacuolar protease A (spot 24), amidase (spot 81), l-amino acid oxidase (spot 82), serine carboxypeptidase (spot 85), serine carboxypeptidase (spot 17), homoserine dehydrogenase (spot 19) and NADP-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase (spot 4). Two F1 abundant proteins named phosphoglycerate kinase (spot 7), and mitochondrial peroxiredoxin (spot 10) were also selected.
