In neonatal pigs, B cell development occurs earlier than T cell development and begins in the yolk sac , . T cells are first detected in the thymus at a gestation of 40 days . Peripheral blood IgM-positive B cells begin to appear at 40 days of gestation . On the other hand, peripheral T cells are generated at 45 days of gestation . In association with B lymphocyte development, the  gene is strongly expressed and V(D)J rearrangement starts at 20 days of gestation , and the rapid elevations of mRNA levels of , and  in the thymus increase from 40 to 65 days of gestation . In this study, we generated -deficient model pigs using gene targeting and SCNT and confirmed the contribution of the  gene to lymphogenesis and the phenotype of -deficient pigs.
