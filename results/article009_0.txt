The regulation of mRNA stability is one of the mechanisms for major regulatory transitions during embryonic development, clearing mRNAs characteristic for an early phase of development and facilitating the control of the next developmental phase or differentiation state by newly transcribed mRNAs .  mRNA metabolism is determined by quantity and time period of transcription, but also by mRNA turnover mechanisms including deadenylation and decapping, defining the half life of an mRNA species during which functional protein can be generated. mRNA turnover is a highly sophisticated and carefully regulated mechanism evolved to establish and maintain the amount of functional protein required by a cell . Recent interest has much focused on the roles of non-coding RNAs in controlling both mRNA translation and mRNA decay in embryogenesis , . Whether and how enzymatic mRNA decay control mechanism  contribute to specific patterning or differentiation decisions during vertebrate embryogenesis is less well understood.
