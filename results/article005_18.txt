We analyzed the impact on ethylene yield when individual reactions were modified by a range of restriction factors, from complete knockout (f = 0) to slight reduction (f = 0.9). We maintained a minimum growth rate of 0.3 hr and maximized ethylene demand. In the core model, numerous off-diagonal solutions are observed, many with yield increases (). The highest yields in this study are obtained when baseline flux values are restricted by 50% ( and , ). When enolase (ENO) or phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) are targeted in mutant F, ethylene yield increases by 25% whereas when fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), phosphofructokinase (PFK), or triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) are targeted in mutant F, yield increases by 23%. The mechanism for yield increase is similar to that for mutant A, wherein, ethanol production shuts off entirely when the flux requirement for NAD+/NADH balance decreases (solutions in Table S4 in ).
