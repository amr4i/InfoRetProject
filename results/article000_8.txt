To assess the suitability of the centrifugation and membrane filtration techniques for the concentration of cells prior to qPCR analyses with and without EMA, a saline solution was inoculated with 10 CFU/ml viable  DSM 4688 cells and diluted in a 10-fold dilution series up to 10 CFU/ml. NaCl at a concentration of 0.9% was used as a solvent to exclude a cell-compromising effect of the water through osmotic pressure. Microbiological cell enumeration was done in triplicate before and after centrifugation or filtration of the spiked NaCl suspensions (dilution steps 10, 10, and 10) to determine the mean loss of cells. A mean significant (<0.05) reduction of 1.080.021 SD log CFU/ml  was detected after centrifugation, whereas the mean reduction after membrane filtration was 0.730.161 SD log CFU/ml (<0.05) (). However, the number of lost cells was independent of the quantities of  cells in the spiked samples. In total, the mean loss of bacteria was significantly (<0.05) higher after centrifugation of  cells compared to membrane filtration.
