In some cases the visualization of networks alone can lend insight into complex topological properties. Example multi-modal networks for a single subject from the Human Connectome Project are shown in . Networks were constructed from high b-value generalized Q-space diffusion imaging  using fiber counts, fMRI using correlation, and MEG using synchronization likelihood . The fMRI network is characterized by the predominance of lateral connections between homologous regions. By contrast, the diffusion and MEG networks have less lateral connectivity, instead consisting mostly of short range connections. Depending on the analysis constraints, with visualization it is sometimes possible to determine some properties of the data, such as the modality of acquisition, solely by inspection. Accordingly, visualization of the network can serve as an important quality control before performing further statistical analysis.
