We have identified a series of ()-2-(2-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)vinyl)quinolinederivatives that effectively induced cell cycle arrest at S phase in both PC3 and LNCaP cells, consequently triggering apoptosis . In the current study, we characterized the most potent compound from this series, CFS-1686, to determine its Top1 activity. We compared the effect of CFS-1686 with CPT on cell cycle progression in PC3 cells by BrdU incorporation and flow cytometry analysis, revealing that CFS-1686 and CPT induce cell cycle arrest at the intra-S phase and G1-S, respectively. Further evaluation of their capacity for DNA damage assessed by the phosphorylation of ATM and by the level of H2AX and its foci demonstrated that CFS-1686 caused light DNA damage, whereas CPT caused heavy DNA damage. CFS-1686 inhibited Top 1 activity 4-fold more than CPT in a DNA relaxation assay, but nevertheless did not induce DNA cleavage. However, it reduced CPT-induced DNA cleavage of Top1 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that CFS-1686 might bind to Top1 to inhibit this enzyme from interacting with DNA. Using a docking strategy, we identified a potential binding site of CFS-1686 in Top1, showing that it might compete with DNA at the DNA binding site of Top1.
