Signals from pulsatile GnRH, released from the hypothalamus, are transmitted through activation of the G-protein coupled GnRH receptor on the surface of gonadotrope cells . In addition to GnRH, activin signaling via binding to activin type II serine/threonine kinase receptors, which results in the phosphorylation of activin type I receptors , is also important for gonadotropin production. Activation of these receptors results in the phosphorylation of downstream Sma- and mothers against decapentaplegic (MAD)-related proteins, SMAD2 and SMAD3 . SMAD2/3 then bind to SMAD4, translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of specific target genes , , . Activin responsiveness of the rodent  promoter has been extensively characterized (reviewed in , ). SMAD2/3/4 have been shown to bind three SMAD binding elements (SBE) at 267, 149 and 116 of the murine  promoter , . Forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) has also been reported to bind three elements at 350, 154 and 113 in the murine  promoter and mutation of these sites disrupt activin induction .
