The maximum yield of 0.38 mol ethylene/mol glucose, a 9% increase over the baseline yield is found for   when glucose transport (GLCpts) is held to 80% of the baseline value. In , yield increases by 6% (0.37 mol ethylene/mol glucose) with respect to baseline when either glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is restricted to 80% of baseline (). The differences between the baseline and the mutant flux distributions are displayed in  (Table S4 in ). We observe that in the baseline case ethanol is produced, which indicates the presence of anaerobic limitations, despite the aerobic constraints simulated. In mutant A, the ethanol production pathway (ACALD, ALCD2x, ETOHt2r, and EX_etoh(e)) is completely off, while pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity increases. PDH reduces NAD to NADH, while ACALD and ALCD2x in the baseline solution regenerate NAD supply. The shifts in these reactions indicate that the ethanol production pathway is active in the baseline solution in order to balance NAD/NADH. Constrictor targeting of GLCpts reduces flux through glycolysis, which reduces the amount of NAD converted to NADH via GAPD. Up-regulation of PDH flux (by 2 mmol/gdcw/hr with respect to baseline) is insufficient to compensate for the decrease in GAPD activity (by 4.2 mmol/gdcw/hr with respect to basline), so the ethanol production pathway shuts off and we observe increased flux through NADH dehydrogenase (NADH16). The decrease in ethanol production when the flux requirement for NAD/NADH balance is reduced gives rise to improved ethylene yield in mutant A.
