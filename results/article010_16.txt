The differences among the three cities reflect both the dramatic increase in vehicle numbers and the decreased usage of coal at the different stages of urban development (). Beijing had the largest contribution from vehicles, which was threefold greater than that of Shijiazhuang. Vehicles have already become one of the main contributors to particle emissions in metropolitans as the one of the main source of NO . For example, direct emission, road dust and secondary nitrates, which were closely related to vehicle use, contributed 27.9%-47.5% to total PM mass concentration in Beijing . Larger transportation sector in Beijing and Tianjin consumed more petroleum, thus contributed more NO emission. The industrial structure of the cities, which we did not investigate in depth, was the cause of the difference between coal and petroleum consumption. Coal was the main energy source, combustion of which results in release of both NO and SO. Shijiazhuang relied substantially on coal combustion, at a level almost threefold greater than that in Beijing. High coal combustion produces higher SO emissions, leading to higher SO concentrations. Therefore [NO]/[SO] ratio here was close related to the energy use in the transport sector and the industrial sector.
