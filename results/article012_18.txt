Consistent with FACS analysis, histologic and immunohistochemistry analyses also showed a lack (abnormal development) of mature lymphocytes and structural defects in the spleen, MLNs, and thymus of the -deficient piglets.  KO piglets devoid of B cells show a complete lack of follicular structure and germinal center organization in MLNs . Moreover, disrupted pigs exhibit greatly reduced T cell development and hypoplastic white pulp in the spleen . Furthermore,  knockout pigs were recently reported to show a hypoplastic periarterial lymphatic sheath and loss of white pulp in the spleen as well as hypoplastic corpuscles in the thymus , . Consistent with these lymphoid-defective pigs and previous reports on rodents, our  neonatal piglets lacking T and B cells demonstrated hypoplasia of the white pulp and lymphoid follicles. Regarding the thymus, the architecture of the medulla and cortex and the lymphocytes were completely lost in  piglets similar to the recent report . Moreover, our  neonatal piglets showed no CD3-positive cells in their thymus, spleen, or MLNs. These histologic findings also clearly prove that the characteristics of our  neonatal piglets did not result from a leaky phenotype.
