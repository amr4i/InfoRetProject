A low-flow rate sampler, TH-16A (Tianhong, Wuhan, China) was deployed at the three city sites, and operated at a flow rate of 16.8 mL/min. A middle-flow rate sampler, TH-150 (Tianhong, Wuhan, China) was deployed at the four background sites, with a flow rate of 100 mL/min. Sampling was carried out at ~23-h intervals, and conducted in each season for 57 days. The four periods were Feb 27 to Mar 10 in spring, Jun 19 to 30 in summer, Sep 10 to 29 in autumn, and Dec 7 to 29 in winter. Windy and/or rainy days were avoided collecting samples. 32 samples for National background point and 2028 samples for each city site were sampled in each season. To assess the ion enrichment in particulate matter of various sizes, daily 23-h integrated PM, PM, PM, TSP (from10:00 am to 9:00 am the next day, local time) samples were collected with pure quartz fiber filters (MUNKTELL, Sweden) using a multi-stage sampler (Kalman, Hungary, Model KS-303.150.10/10/2.5/1+PAH7) in Beijing. Teflon filters (Pall International, Cat) were used to determine the concentrations by mass of the atmospheric particles, The filters were weighed with a microbalance before and after sampling under identical conditions in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room (201C and 355% relative humidity).
