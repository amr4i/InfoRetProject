RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 48-well culture plates (110 cells/well) and cultured overnight. Then, the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and LPS (100 ng/mL) with gentiopicroside, swertiamarin or gentiolactone for 4 hours. Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan) and used to synthesize cDNA with the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan); all kits were used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with the gene specific primers listed in  and Fast SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems). The qRT-PCR data were normalized against  (NM_007393).
