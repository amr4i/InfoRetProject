To achieve the overarching goal of creating robust platforms for predictive strain engineering, it is necessary to apply lessons learned from a multitude of FBA frameworks into experimental strain design strategies, including those that focus on improving computational efficiency , , , introducing novel and non-native pathways , defining biologically relevant objectives , incorporating experimental gene expression data , , and exploring gene addition , deletion, and over- or under-expression , , . Unlike other FBA based optimization techniques, Constrictor provides a framework that samples an unexplored solution space by combinatorially analyzing various degrees of inhibitory effects of genetic mutations on the performance of biochemical networks. We demonstrate that by subtly or dramatically reducing flux through specific pathways, a distribution of solutions can be obtained that reveal novel metabolic engineering targets. Constrictor is a generally applicable technique for computationally generating and analyzing mutant strains, and can be incorporated into any metabolic flux analysis method that uses linear programming methodology, including regulated , , dynamic , and thermodynamic models , . Because Constrictor operates independently of objective function, it has the potential to be used in conjunction with minimization of metabolic adjustment , regulatory on/off minimization , or with multi-objective optimization algorithms , .
