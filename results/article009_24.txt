In summary, our data indicate that zebrafish Cnot8 contributes to regulation of proper transcript levels for a subset of developmental control and differentiation genes during embryogenesis, confirming conserved functions of Caf1, Pop2, and Cnot7/8 from yeast to vertebrates. The enhanced activity of Fgf3 signaling in the  mutant helped us to uncover a role for Fgf3 in controlling the number of DA neurons developing in the zebrafish caudal hypothalamus. The  mutantion may be a useful model to further study the contribution and mechanisms of the Ccr4-Not complex towards control of transcript levels during development.
