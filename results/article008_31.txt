The shift rule proposed in this study is more conservative than the shift rules that are usually suggested , , . Perla and Provost suggest using only 6 data points to signal a shift. Carey suggests 7 data points for a run chart with up to 19 data points. The shift rule we suggest takes at least 8 data points to signal a shift if one has between 12 and 22 data points in total. Of course, the choice of cut off value is a trade-off between the need to quickly pick up a signal when the process is changing and the risk of picking up false signals when no change is present. One should be aware that relaxing the rules will result in higher false signal rates.
