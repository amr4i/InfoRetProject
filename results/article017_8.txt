Transient transfections were performed in triplicate and each experiment was repeated at least three times as indicated in the figure legend. The data were normalized for transfection efficiency by expressing luc activity relative to -gal and then made relative to the empty pGL3 plasmid to control for FOXO1 effects on the empty vector. The data were analyzed by Student's -test for independent samples, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc comparisons with the Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference test or two-way ANOVA to determine synergy as described in  using the statistical package JMP 11.0 (SAS, Cary, NC). Significant differences were designated as <0.05.
