Previously, we reported that the FOXO1 transcription factor is expressed in gonadotrope cells and that its phosphorylation and cellular localization are regulated by insulin signaling in a PI3K-dependent manner . We also demonstrated that FOXO1 overexpression inhibits basal and GnRH induction of  and  synthesis in immortalized gonadotrope cells , . Since FOXO1 was reported to interact with SMAD3/4 in immortalized keratinocytes , we hypothesized that FOXO1 may also modulate activin signaling in gonadotrope cells. In this study, we used the immortalized gonadotrope-derived LT2 cell model to determine whether FOXO1 alters activin induction of  gene expression and to investigate the mechanisms involved.
