The inhibitory effects of the CYP specific inhibitors on the metabolic clearance rate of MH in the HLMs were shown in . The concentrations of FUR, TRA, SUL, QUI, TIC and KET were 1 M, except for CHL, which was 5 M. The concentrations were selected on the basis of previously reported  or  values for the CYP isoforms to ensure adequate inhibitory selectivity, as well as maximal inhibitory potency. In the presence of FUR (1 M) and TIC (1 M), the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of MH decreased to 29.17.2% and 41.311.1% of that of the control, respectively (). However, other inhibitors had no obvious inhibitory effects on the metabolism of MH. The screened enzymes were further confirmed by human recombinant CYPs by using the specific inhibitors, the MCRs of MH were decreased to 43.5% (MH, 10 M) and 60.5% (MH, 50 M) of that of the control for CYP1A2 and to 68.5% (MH, 10 M) and 80.5% (MH, 50 M) of that of the control for CYP2C19 (). The results indicated that CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 were possibly the major enzymes responsible for the metabolism of MH .
