The main result of the present communication is that phenyl ring, ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry, in some cases could be replaced by an adamantyl ring without loss but improvement of the biological properties. To the ,  and  positions of a phenyl ring correspond to 1,2, 1,3 and 1,4-substituents on an adamantyl ring. This is in agreement with our findings since the 1,4-derivative, with a similar substitution to that of paracetamol, has shown greater potency than the 1,3-derivative.
