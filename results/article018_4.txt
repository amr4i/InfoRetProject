Monocytes and moDCs were generated from buffy coats from healthy, anonymous donors (provided by the blood bank Salzburg, Austria) using the adherence method as described before . Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats by gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (PAA, GE Healthcare, Pasching, Austria). After erythrocyte lysis using ACK buffer (150 mM ammonium chloride, 10 mM potassium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM EDTA) and extensive washing with RPMI 1640 medium, cells were left to adhere for 90 min at 37C and 5% CO in six-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% i.a. FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol. Non-adherent cells were then removed by extensive washing using warm RPMI 1640 medium. For the generation of moDCs, adherent monocytes were stimulated with 50 ng/ml GM-CSF and 50 ng/ml IL-4 (kind gifts from Novartis, Vienna, Austria) for six days. At day 3, 1 vol of the supplemented medium containing fresh cytokines was added.
