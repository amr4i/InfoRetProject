In contrast to the  system, in , both Cpn10(2) and Cpn20 can form fully functional homo-oligomers , , . In the present work, we found that the third co-chaperonin from , Cpn10(1), forms inactive, low molecular weight species in solution. Our results additionally showed that subunits of both Cpn10(1) and Cpn10(2) can combine with Cpn20 to form active hetero-oligomers. This was shown by: i) The increase in activity resulting from addition of inactive Cpn10(1) to Cpn20 (), ii) The hetero-oligomeric species observed by native gels and gel filtration ( and ), iii) The ability to reconstitute functional, protein folding co-chaperonin by combining inactive Cpn10(1) and an inactive Cpn20 mutant (G32A) (), iv) The ability of G32ACpn10(1) hetero-oligomers to stimulate formation of Cpn601 oligomers () and v) The ability of inactive G32A to enhance the activity of Cpn10(2) ().
