Several reports have described pathways of APAP to exert its analgesic activity. Unlike non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), whose analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects are related to their inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), paracetamol is a weak anti-inflammatory agent with an absence of COX-related adverse effects . In the brain and spinal cord paracetamol is metabolized by fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH) to -arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404). AM404 is a known activator of the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1)  and the cannabinoid CB receptor system  both of which confer analgesia in the central nervous system. The main drawback found in the use of paracetamol is the mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) . APAP metabolites (e.g. N-acetyl--benzoquinoneimine (NAPQ1) have centered the attention because of their toxic actions causing hepatotoxicity . Many articles have been devoted to this topic  and different attempts have been made to circumvent this problem. For instance, 3-hydroxyacetanilide is non hepatotoxic because the oxygen atoms of quinones can only be at 1,2-,, or, 4-positions,  . Other authors have designed new analgesics derived from the paracetamol metabolite (AM404) having an anandamide chain instead of the acetamido group . The replacement of the methyl group by saccharin or an open form of it (SCP-1 and SCP-123) improves considerably its water solubility . A proline prodrug was developed with this purpose  and a paracetamol analogue known as propacetamol is currently in the market. Note that paracetamol presents polymorphism . Whereas researchers have been trying to avoid the formation of the metabolite responsible for APAP toxicity designing non-hepatotoxic paracetamol analogues , a new antinociceptive mechanism driven by activation of TRPA1 in the spinal cord by APAP metabolites such as NAPQ1 has been reported .
