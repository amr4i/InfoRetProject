A number of studies have been published that use the FBA framework to reveal non-obvious network characteristics. Optknock was developed for designing  knockout strains that redirect flux from biomass to biochemical production . OptReg and OptForce expanded upon the Optknock framework by exploring combinations of gene up-regulation, down-regulation, and deletion to find metabolic engineering targets , . Because combinatorial analysis of gene targets with FBA scales exponentially, alternate algorithms have been applied to efficiently study metabolic networks. Genetic algorithms , successive linear programming , and local search  have succeeded in rapidly locating target modifications with order of magnitude reductions in computational time. These approaches can incorporate mixed integer linear programming problems, such that simulated constraints generated via OptKnock or others can be solved with efficient algorithms; examples include the use of OptKnock and OptGene  and OptReg*LS . The current FBA-inspired methods allow optimization of fluxes and identification of gene targets for deletion, up-regulation, and down-regulation; however, there continues to be a need for alternate approaches that allow for comparison between subtle variations in gene expression and metabolic network behavior.
