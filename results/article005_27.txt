Recent high-throughput recombineering techniques demonstrate that combinatorial exploration of the genomic space can reveal optimal mutants, while computational techniques prove to be well suited to analyze these combinations. Modifications suggested by Constrictor can be translated into  modifications via a wealth of available strain engineering tools. Recently, characterization of promoter and upstream element sequences have enabled specific ranges of gene expression to be realized . Similarly, emerging techniques that use small regulatory RNAs to target specific genes appear to be especially well-suited for implementing Constrictor predictions. The CRISPR interference system, which uses a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein to inhibit transcription of genes homologous to a guide RNA sequence, has been demonstrated to be tunable according to the location of the DNA target . Implementing riboregulators is another strategy for achieving modular expression from selected genes . In light of these and other advances in synthetic biology and genome engineering, it is becoming increasingly possible to achieve precise performance from biological parts, which allows for enhanced integration of strain engineering efforts and  predictions.
