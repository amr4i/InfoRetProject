10 L of purified MCPs, at a concentration of 100 g/mL, were placed on 400 mesh formvar coated copper grids with a carbon film for two minutes. The grids were washed three times with deionized water, then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for two minutes. Samples were observed and photographed with a Gatan Ultrascan 1000 camera (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) on a FEI Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope.
