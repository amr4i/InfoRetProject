The analysis was repeated using two genome scale models: iAF1260 (), from which the core model was derived, and iJO1366 (), the most current  genome scale model. The baseline solution for each is obtained via the maximization of ethylene demand with constraints as described in  section. The baseline yield and production rate are found to be identical for the core and iAF1260 models (), though there are 437 reactions active in the iAF1260 baseline solution (Table S5 in ) versus the 72 active in the core baseline. The baseline solution in the iJO1366 model predicts a yield that is higher than that of the iAF1260 based models, at 0.43 mol ethylene/mol glucose, and includes 569 active reactions (Table S6 in ). When Constrictor is used to apply restrictions from 0 to 90% of the iAF1260 or iJO1366 baseline flux, higher yield and off-diagonal solutions are obtained. Neither the amount of flux restriction nor the targeted reactions that lead to the highest yield are completely consistent across models, though all top-performing targets impact glycolysis. The highest yield found in the iAF1260 model (18% increase over baseline, ) is obtained when glucose transport is restricted to 70% of the baseline value, while the second highest yield (12% increase over baseline, ) is obtained when GAPD or PGK are held at 40% of their baseline flux. As in mutant B and mutant H, the highest yielding solutions  and  associated with the iJO1366 model are obtained by targeting GAPD or PGK. In mutant I, these reactions are constricted to 30% of baseline to provide an 18% increase in yield, and in mutant J, held at 20% of baseline for a 5% yield increase. For each of these mutants, ethanol production decreases by 100% with respect to baseline, indicating that oxygen limitation plays a role in suppressing the baseline yield. The complete flux solutions for each mutant are available in Tables S5 and S6 in .
