Because of its crucial function for cells, especially in DNA replication, Top1 has become an attractive drug target for anticancer chemotherapy . Several anticancer drugs drive cancer cells toward apoptosis by inducing the Top1-DNA cleavage complex (Top1-DNAcc) . They are roughly classified into two groups, camptothecin (CPT) with CPT derivatives and non-CPT Top1 inhibitors, all belonging to the interfacial inhibitor of Top1-DNAcc . These inhibitors bind reversibly at the interface of Top1-DNAcc to stabilize this transient complex . This action might slow down the Top1 catalytic cycles, leading to DNA damage as the fast movements of the replication complexes collide with this drug-stalled complex. So far, only CPT derivatives such as topotecan and irinotecan have been approved by the FDA as Top1-targeted drugs for various forms of cancer. Several non-CPT Top1 inhibitors are still in clinical development . In addition to the interfacial inhibitors of Top1-DNAcc, the catalytic inhibitors of Top1 might be worth developing for clinical and Top1 mechanistic studies . The compounds in this category can inhibit the DNA relaxation of Top1 and the formation of Top1-DNA complexes, but they cannot induce Top1-DNAcc .
