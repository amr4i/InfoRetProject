GST-SMAD2/3/4 were provided by Dr. Rik Derynck and the GFP expression vector by Dr. Douglass Forbes. S-labeled proteins were produced using the TnT Coupled Reticulolysate System. Bacteria transformed with GST plasmids were grown to OD of 0.6 and induced with IPTG overnight at 30C . Bacterial pellets were sonicated in 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA in 1 PBS, centrifuged and the supernatant was bound to glutathione sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Beads were washed 4 in PBS and in HND buffer (10 mg/ml BSA, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1% NP-40). For the interaction assay, 20 l of S-labeled  transcribed and translated GFP, FOXO1, FOXO1-CA, or FOXO1-CA-DBD mutant was added to the beads with 400 l of HND buffer. Beads were incubated overnight at 4C, washed 2 with HND buffer and 2 with 0.1% NP-40 in PBS. Thirty l of 2 Laemmli load buffer was added, the samples were boiled and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. One fourth of the S-labeled  transcribed-translated product was loaded onto the gel as input.
