An additional method was used in order to demonstrate the functional interaction between Cpn10(1) and Cpn20. We took advantage of the ability of various co-chaperonins to induce the oligomerization of Cpn60 monomers, as demonstrated in Vitlin et al., . Consistent with their inability to assist Cpn60-facilitated refolding, neither Cpn10(1) nor G32A alone was able to stimulate the formation of Cpn601 oligomers (, lane 1 and 3 respectively). In contrast, a mixture of the two inactive co-chaperonins had an effect that was similar to that observed when wild type Cpn20 was added (, lane 5 and 2 respectively), resulting in formation of Cpn601 oligomer.
