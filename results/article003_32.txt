Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism are important for energy production because they participate in glycolysis to produce ATP. In , the high abundance of several enzymes, such as enolase, FBA, phosphoglycerate kinase, and triosephosphate isomerase, leads to relatively higher anaerobic metabolism of glucose and energy production . Here, we found that several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were more highly expressed in F4 than in F1. Among them, chitinase 1 and -galactosidase 2 are important for the strong virulence of F4 , . Glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase (spot 99) participates in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis by catalyzing the reversible conversion of --glucose-6-phosphate to --glucose-6-phosphate . Enolase (spot 22), a ubiquitous glycolytic enzyme, catalyzes the dehydration of 2-phospho--glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in glycolysis. Additionally, adenosine kinase (spot 3) is important for the regulation of cellular levels of adenosine and its nucleotides. The above three enzymes are directly involved in glycolysis, and their higher expression levels in F4 might help this race to survive the plant defense system. ATP synthesis is necessity for all organisms and depends on the transmembrane hydrogen ion/proton transporting activity of ATP synthase. We identified 4 protein spots as ATP synthase (spots 38, 40, 46, and 49). Although there is no direct evidence that these enzymes contribute to the virulence of , these proteins appear to be of some importance for F4. Future knockout studies of these genes to produce weakly pathogenic or non-pathogenic strains will provide additional insight for further investigation of banana Fusarium wilt.
