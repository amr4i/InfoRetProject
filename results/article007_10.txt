Male (Costa Rica and Germany Greenhouse) as well as female (Germany Greenhouse)  spp. showed the tongue flicking behavior. Each of the male bees in Costa Rica did so on at least two of the six days they were observed. There were no obvious differences between the two species regarding results on nectar evaporation despite the differences in body size and relative proboscis length. They spent between 0 and 234/245 minutes ( and , respectively, see ) of the 300 minute observation period showing tongue flicking behavior. There was no correlation between the offered sugar concentration and the duration of the tongue flicking behavior (Spearman rank correlation, :  = 0.3068, rho  = 0.1341; :  = 0.9007, rho  = 0.0149, ). Resulting crop sugar concentrations were always higher than those that had been offered in the artificial flowers (one exception, see ), with a significant change in sugar concentration after tongue flicking for all tested concentrations and both species (Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data, <0.05, see ). The sugar concentration of crop contents reached values as high as 72.6% for  and 75.6% for , up to 34.8% higher than the originally imbibed concentration. Average values for resulting sugar concentrations of crop contents were lower due to a general variability in duration and efficiency of tongue flicking behavior, and some individuals did not show tongue flicking behavior at all on some of the days (see ), but remained generally inactive, spending most of the observation time hanging by their mandibles from leaves or the mesh walls in a torpor-like state. In cases in which individuals had not engaged in tongue flicking behavior, crop content concentration was on average 6.8% (, n = 5 cases, SD: 2.0%) and 4.8% (, n = 17 cases, SD: 4.5%) higher than the respective feeder sugar concentration. This was however significantly lower than the average concentration difference of crop content to offered sugar-water in all cases in which tongue flicking occurred (14.9%, SD: 6.8%, and 19.5%, SD: 9.5%; Welch two sample t-test: , t = 6.2966, df = 15, <0.001; , t = 8.7303, df = 58, <0.001). Additionally, duration of tongue flicking behavior and resulting concentration were positively correlated (, ) in all but one case (30% initial concentration for , Spearman rank correlation,  = 0.1909, see ). Evaporative water loss from the artificial feeders during the respective days led to values maximally 1% higher than the sugar concentration measured in the morning (), and could therefore not have been responsible for the higher concentrations found in the crop contents.
