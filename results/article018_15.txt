To assesses whether these small amounts of LPS are capable of activating NF-B-signalling, we generated a highly LPS-responsive cell system modified from Peters and colleagues  by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with expression plasmids encoding the LPS receptor subunits TLR4, CD14 and MD-2 along with an NF-B luciferase reporter plasmid. These cells were exposed to different concentrations of recombinant protein 1 from suppliers 1 and 2, as well as to different amounts of LPS. As shown in , the recombinant protein from supplier 1 induced an increase in NF-B activity, whereas the protein from supplier 2 did not activate NF-B (even at 400 ng/ml, twice as high as the maximum protein concentration tested from supplier 1). Interestingly, the protein from supplier 1 induced NF-B activation in the same range as 0.02 ng/ml LPS. Of note, this LPS concentration is approximately equivalent to the amount of contamination in 100 ng of recombinant protein, as measured in the LAL test above. This experiment clearly shows that even the small amounts of endotoxin contamination found in commercially available recombinant proteins are sufficient to activate NF-B in a highly sensitive cell system.
