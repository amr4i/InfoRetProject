The two races of  were isolated from banana leaves and mantained in our laboratory , . Single spores from F1 and F4 were separated and grown on potato dextrose agar for one week at 27C. A small piece of each plaque was transferred to the KK liquid medium (0.1% KHPO w/v, 0.05% KCl w/v, 0.05% MgSO 7HO w/v, 0.001% Fe-Na EDTA w/v, 0.2% aspartic acid w/v, 1% D galactose w/v, pH 5.0) and cultured under in a shaking chamber at 27C, and 120 rpm for additional two days. Both races were then examined by light microscopy. Similarly, the growth and dry weight content of the two races at different time point were determined as described . For each sample, 10 biological replicates were examined and the results shown are the mean  standard deviation (n = 10). Finally, ~1 mL of the above KK liquid medium containing F1 or F4 was added to 200 mL of fresh KK liquid medium, and the cultures were shaken at 27C, and 120 rpm for an additional 2, 4, or 6 days. The cultures were centrifuged at 15,000 for 15 min at 4C, and the bottom fraction containing mycelia was washed twice with KK liquid and partially dried by filtration through three sheets of 1 mm Whatman No. 2 filter paper in a Buchner funnel. The samples were immediately frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen, and the ground fungal mycelia were stored at 80C for proteomic analysis.
