We recently published that overexpression of the FOXO1 transcription factor in immortalized LT2 gonadotrope cells resulted in decreased basal and GnRH-induced  and  gene expression , . To determine whether FOXO1 can modulate activin signaling in gonadotropes, we transfected LT2 cells with a multimer containing four repeats of a consensus FBE fused with a luc reporter gene (4FBE-luc) along with constitutively active FOXO1 (FOXO1-CA), which remains in the nucleus due to the inability of insulin/growth factor signaling to phosphorylate the mutated residues. Overexpression of FOXO1-CA increased expression of the 4FBE-luc but activin treatment did not result in significantly increased transcription of the 4FBE-luc in the absence or presence of FOXO1-CA (). In contrast to the 4FBE-luc, overexpression of FOXO1 reduced expression of 1000 bp of the murine  promoter fused to a luc reporter gene (m-luc). As previously reported , both wild-type FOXO1 and FOXO1-CA reduced basal expression of m-luc (). Additionally, although the fold activin induction of the murine  promoter was not significantly decreased by wild-type FOXO1, FOXO1-CA significantly reduced activin induction of  by 50% (). The lack of a significant decrease in activin induction of  due to overexpression of wild-type FOXO1 was not altogether unexpected since we previously showed that transfection of LT2 cells with pcDNA3 FOXO1 resulted in FOXO1 being predominantly localized in the cytoplasm with some nuclear localization whereas pcDNA FOXO1-CA was localized in the nucleus .
