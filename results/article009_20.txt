Analysis of  expression revealed that maternal  mRNA is deposited in the embryo and  is expressed zygotically at early zebrafish embryonic and larval stages in a ubiquitous fashion. Thus, Cnot8 may function in all cells of the embryo. cnot8 and other components of the Ccr4-Not complex were also reported to be expressed ubiquitously during all developmental stages at least until 3 dpf in zebrafish ( data base search).
