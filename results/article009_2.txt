Dopaminergic (DA) neurons are intensively studied both because of the medical relevance of DA neurons for many neurological diseases, and because DA neurons are an excellent paradigm for differentiation of neurons of one transmitter phenotype in diverse regions of the brain . Zebrafish have become popular as animal model to study DA differentiation, because of ease of genetic and experimental access and excellent visualization of neuronal types in the transparent embryos and larvae . Most zebrafish DA groups topologically correspond to those typically found in other vertebrates. Like in mammals, DA neurons develop in the olfactory bulb (OB; mammalian A16) and in the retina (mammalian A17) of zebrafish. The prethalamic group (numbered DC1 in larvae) is homologous to mammalian neurons of the prethalamic zona incerta (A13). All DA clusters located in the posterior tuberculum in zebrafish (groups DC 2, 4, 5, and 6) require the activity of the transcription factor Orthopedia (Otp) and are homologous to the OTP-depending A11 DA in the mammalian brain . The DA groups of the preoptic region and the hypothalamus (groups DC 3 and 7) in zebrafish correlate with mammalian A12 and A14 DA groups. Zebrafish however lack ventral midbrain DA neurons homologous to the mammalian A8-10 group. Instead, an additional group of DA neurons exists in the zebrafish striatum , , . Most studies in zebrafish have focused on transcriptional control of DA groups , especially of the A11-type DA neurons , and on signaling mechanisms ,. Studies on signaling mechanisms have provided insight into mechanisms controlling the number of DA neurons for the A11-type DA group , , . In contrast, very little is known about mechanisms that control DA neuron number in other anatomical groups, including the hypothalamic ones.
