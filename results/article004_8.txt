A pilot inhibitory analysis of each CYP isoform was performed to determine the potency of inhibition and to select CYP isoforms for further detailed study of their inhibitions. MH (various concentrations of 0.5100 M) and a single CYP isoform-specific substrate (concentration at about the respective  value) were used to determine the inhibitory effect of MH on specific CYP isoforms. Substrates including phenacetin, coumarin, tolbutamide, metoprolol, chlorzoxazone, S-Mephenytoin and midazolam were employed at concentrations of 10, 5, 100, 7.5, 40, 100 and 5 M, respectively . All incubation conditions were the same as mentioned above. The inhibitory effects on the CYP isoforms were investigated individually by incubating the HLMs in the absence or presence of MH. Incubation solution with the solvent that was used to dissolve MH was regarded as the negative control, whereas solutions containing the specific inhibitors mentioned above were regarded as the positive controls. The  values of MH were determined and compared with those of the specific inhibitors mentioned above (see ).
