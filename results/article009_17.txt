To specifically investigate if Fgf3 signaling is involved in the formation of the DC7 DA  mutant phenotype we used the  mutation, which eliminates Fgf3 activity , and generated  double mutants. Embryos were analyzed at 4 dpf by anti-TH immunofluorescene and confocal stacks were recorded. Using the confocal data, DA neurons were counted in embryos of WT, single mutant, and double mutant backgrounds (). In  mutant embryos DA neurons of DC1-6 develop normally () indicating that the development of these neurons does not depend on Fgf3 signaling. DC7 neurons are about 20% reduced in number in  mutants in comparison to WT siblings (p = 0.024). Most interestingly  double mutants have on average of 52.6 DC7 DA neurons, and thus a significant reduction can be observed in comparison to  double mutants having an average of 103.4 DC7 DA neurons (p = 0.008). Loss of Fgf3 signaling in a  mutant background results in a reduction of DC7 DA neurons almost restoring DA cell numbers counted in WT genetic background (; cell numbers not significantly different; p = 0.45). These findings indicate that Fgf3 signaling, although not strictly required for differentiation of the caudal hypothalamic DA group DC7, has an important role in determining the number of these dopaminergic neurons.
