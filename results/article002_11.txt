To quickly assess the impact of various conditions on the regulation of the  operon, we constructed a reporter plasmid (P-GFP) for  transcription, in which transcription of green fluorescent protein () is driven by activation of the P promoter; this approach was successfully employed to investigate other operons , . We first used this reporter to verify that 1,2-PD activates the P promoter in . Using flow cytometry to measure cellular fluorescence, we observed the first increase in fluorescence two hours after the addition of 1,2-PD (, see also Fig. S1A in ). Fluorescence continued to increase over the course of several hours, indicating continued transcription from the P promoter.
