Venn diagram analysis revealed that 48 and 51 proteins were respectively identified from F1 and F4 (). Among them, 29 proteins were specifically observed only in F1, and 28 proteins were specific to F4. Among the 42 shared proteins, 23 proteins were up-regulated in F4, whereas the other 19 proteins were more abundant in F1 (). For F1, 22, 25, and 30 proteins were respectively identified in the 2-, 4-, and 6-day culture samples (). For F4, 29, 27, and 29 proteins were respectively obtained in the 2-, 4- and 6-day culture mycelia (). Among the F1-specific proteins, three spots were detected only in the 2- and 4- days, five spots at only days 2 and 6, three spots at only days 4 and 6, and nine spots were detected on all three days. For F4, four proteins were specific to day 2 and 6, four proteins to days 2 and 6, 4 proteins at 4 and 6 days, and ten proteins were observed on all three days (; ).
