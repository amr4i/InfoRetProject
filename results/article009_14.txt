The DA phenotype in the caudal hypothalamus was qualitatively different from other CA groups in that not just the  expression level was increased, but also the number of caudal hypothalamic neurons appeared increased. Therefore signaling pathways controlling DA differentiation in this anatomical region may be affected. FGF signaling namely through Fgf3 has been demonstrated to be important in caudal hypothalamus development . Expression analysis of  by WISH and quantification of signal intensity revealed that  mutants have a mild increase of  WISH intensity already at 2 dpf (), both in the mid-hindbrain boundary expression domain (p = 0.008) and in the caudal hypothalamus (p = 0.008).  WISH signal continues to be enhanced in both domains at 3 dpf (; MHB p = 0.008. cHyp p = 0.004). We also analyzed expression of FGF receptor encoding genes ,  and  in  embryos. While at 1 dpf WISH signal intensities of , 2,  and  are not significantly altered in  mutants (), at 2 dpf  and  showed increased WISH stain intensities in mutants (;  ventral hindbrain domain p = 0.008;  dorsal forebrain and midbrain p = 0.008), while  and  WISH signal levels were not altered in comparison to WT siblings. WISH signals of , , , and  were up-regulated in  mutants at 3 dpf (;  lower jaw p = 0.031;  dorsal forebrain/midbrain p = 0.016;  hindbrain p = 0.016;  dorsal midbrain p = 0.008).
