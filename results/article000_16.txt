Finally, the applicability of the EMA-qPCR method was assessed in tap water samples spiked with defined ratios (1:10 and 1:100) of viable and heat-killed cells of type strain DSM 4688,  (n = 2) or  (n = 2) field isolates. With the limitation that a relatively low number of samples (n = 14) was included, Bland-Altman analysis indicated a high agreement between EMA-qPCR results and microbiological cell counts. The mean difference was 0.0060.531 SD CFU (log) and the lower and upper limits were 1.047 and 1.035 CFU (log) (). In contrast, results from qPCR experiments without EMA differed noticeably from CFU determination (mean: 1.8271.054 SD log CFU, 95% limits of agreement 3.892 and +0.238).
