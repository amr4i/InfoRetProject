GO biological process analysis of the 99 proteins revealed that most proteins are involved in antioxidation processes such as response to oxidative stress, superoxide metabolism, and cell redox homeostasis. Another large portion was involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Followed proton transport coupled with ATP synthesis or ATP hydrolysis, glycolysis, and proteolysis (). GO molecular function analysis of the 99 proteins revealed that the largest portion was showed strong oxidoreductase activity (OXDA) (). Another large portion has ATP-binding activities, catalase activities, cation ion-binding activities, and kinase activities. Several of proteins were predicted to enzymes with endopeptidase activity, galactosidase activity, hydrolase activity, and protein binding (). At the GO-cellular component level, 88 of the 99 identified proteins showed no detailed locations. Five proteins deemed to be involved in proton transport, and several enzymes were predicted to be integrated into phosphopyruvate hydratase complex, eukaryotic translation elongation factor complexes, or to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum ().
