We finally tested whether the Pdu MCPs formed following heterologous PocR expression were functional for 1,2-PD metabolism. While a  knockout strain of  expressing MBP from a control vector showed no growth in media containing 1,2-PD as the sole carbon source, growth on 1,2-PD was restored in a  knockout strain over-expressing PocR. Furthermore,   over-expressing PocR grew faster than wild type  expressing MBP from a control vector, which only expresses native levels of PocR from its genomic locus. This increase in growth rate is also observed for wild type  over-expressing PocR. (see Fig. S8 in ).
