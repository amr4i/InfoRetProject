Identification of the active constituents was performed by mass spectroscopy (Jeol JMS-700, Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) (Jeol EX-400, JeolL Ltd.), UV (Shimazu UV mini 1240, Shimazu Co., Kyoto, Japan) and optical rotation (Jasco DIP1000, Nihon Bunko Co., Tokyo, Japan). All physico-chemical properties, such as fragmentation, molecular formulas, chemical shifts for carbon, UV spectrum and optical rotation ([] = -1.4 ( = 0.15, MeOH)), were identical with reported data for ()-gentiolactone (purity >95% by HPLC, ) .
