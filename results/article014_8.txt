Previous studies have reported the reconstitution of active chloroplast chaperonin homo- or hetero-oligomers from monomers , . The same protocol is used in this study with minor modifications as follows: The reconstitution mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl, 16 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mM ATP, 150 M Cpn602, 100 M Cpn603 and 50 M mt-cpn10, was incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature and then for 1 hour at 30C. For oligomer purification, oligomers and monomers in the reconstitution reaction were separated using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol at room temperature. Fractions containing oligomers were pooled, and treated with NiNTA-agarose beads in order to remove any traces of his-tagged mt-cpn10 that might have co-purified with the Cpn60. The relevant fractions were concentrated and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
