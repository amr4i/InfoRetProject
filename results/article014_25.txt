How are Cpn10 and Cpn20 molecules arranged in the co-chaperonin hetero-oligomer? Data from the  chloroplast proteome has shown that Cpn20 levels are roughly an order of magnitude greater than those of Cpn10(2) , . This discrepancy is even greater for the Cpn10(1) homolog, which was not detected in studies of the  proteome. These levels suggest that the dominant arrangement  most likely consists of three Cpn20 molecules with one Cpn10(2) subunit, or one Cpn10(1) subunit.  presents a model for the various equilibria that may exist in solution among  chloroplast co-chaperonins. Our results, together with proteomic data, suggest that hetero-oligomeric co-chaperonins are present in chloroplast in addition to homo-oligomeric Cpn20.
