Cpn10(1) was purified based on the Cpn10(2) purification protocol  with several differences. Briefly,  BL21 (T7) strain, carrying the pET22b - Cpn10(1) plasmid, was grown overnight at 37C in LB medium containing 200 g/ml ampicillin and 34 g/ml chloramphenicol. Next, the starter was diluted 1:30 and grown at 37C to an OD of 0.6. The induction of Cpn10(1) expression was initiated by the addition of 1 mM IPTG and the bacteria was incubated in a shaker at 16C overnight. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (1:10 w/v) containing: 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 mM PMSF (Roche) and disrupted by microfluidizer. The lysate was spun at 14000 rpm for 1 hour at 4C and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 M filter (Whatman) and loaded onto an anion exchange column (Mono-Q, GH Healthcare), that was pre-washed with buffer D (20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4 and 5% (v/v) glycerol). Bound proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient (0%50%, 90 ml and flow rate of 1 ml/min) of buffer E (20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 1M NaCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol). Enriched fractions were pooled and concentrated to 3 ml, which was loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with buffer F (20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl). The column was developed at 1 ml/min (4C). Relevant fractions were collected, concentrated to 3 ml and loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE healthcare) equilibrated with buffer F. Relevant fractions were collected, concentrated and the protein concentration was determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Sigma), with BSA as a standard. All molar protein concentrations refer to protomer concentration unless otherwise indicated.
