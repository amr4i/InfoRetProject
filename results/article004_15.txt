For CYP1A2, the  values were determined using phenacetin as the probe substrate. Of all CYPs tested, CYP1A2 was the most sensitive to the inhibition by MH (). The representative Dixon plots for the inhibition of CYP1A2 in the HLMs were shown in . Visual inspection of the Dixon plots and further analysis of the parameters of the enzyme inhibition models suggested that the inhibition data fit well to a competitive type of inhibition. The  values estimated by using a nonlinear regression model for the competitive enzyme inhibition of CYP1A2-catalyzed phenacetin O-deethylation in the HLMs were less than 5 M (, ). . Shows the Dixon plots for the inhibition of CYP2C19 by MH in the HLMs. MH inhibited CYP2C19 competitively, with estimated  values of 42.65 M (, ).
