Increased proportions of viable cells after centrifugation and membrane filtration of samples compared to untreated (NaCl) controls indicated a loss, in particular, of nonviable cells. If membrane-compromised cells pass through the pores of the filter or are suspended in the supernatant following centrifugation, this could impact the number of nonviable cells after applying both concentration methods. Nevertheless, considering that the EMA-qPCR approach only detects viable cells, negative effects on microbiological counts could be excluded. Although the increase in the proportion of viable cells was comparable between centrifuged and filtrated samples, results from qPCR without EMA directly following centrifugation overestimated the quantities of  cells compared to the reference method (mean difference of 0.78 log CFU/ml), whereas EMA-qPCR did not. In contrast, no significant differences between qPCR and EMA-qPCR results could be detected following filtration of samples. This difference may be attributed to the incomplete removal of free DNA after centrifugation of samples and, thus, can be considered a comparative advantage of the filtration method. Both PCR techniques achieved high correlation coefficients (R = 0.942 without EMA and R = 0.893 with EMA) between  quantities, as determined by qPCR and microbiological cell counts, indicating a basic suitability of EMA-qPCR following the concentration of cells via membrane filtration.
