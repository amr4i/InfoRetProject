The  mutant line was previously described . Embryos were genotyped by PCR using the following primers: forward 5  3 and reverse 5  3. PCR conditions: 94C 2 min; 94C 1 min; 56C 1 min; 72C 1 min; 35 cycles. The PCR product had a length of 200 bp. The  mutation generates an EcoRV site: PCR product digestion from yielded a 180 bp fragment indicative of the mutant allele.
