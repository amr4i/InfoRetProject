Resting state from direct bioelectric signals, EEG and MEG, has gained a renewed interest, in part due to the analysis techniques from BOLD fMRI. The high temporal sensitivity of electrophysiological data allows the direct exploration of connectivity as cortical oscillations . Common metrics used to capture spectral regularities between signals include phase-locking value , imaginary coherence , phase-lag index , , as well as many others . In order to more closely approximate resting networks found in fMRI, novel techniques for network construction from EEG and MEG data using correlations and statistical analyses of power envelopes have additionally been developed . MNE python , Brainstorm , and Brainwave () are open-source software packages with the ability to calculate many spectral connectivity metrics from EEG and MEG data.
