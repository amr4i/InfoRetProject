In the present study, we have shown that MH is a substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, especially CYP1A2. Our data and findings suggested that MH was unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. Of the seven CYPs studied, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 were screened out as participating in the metabolism of MH, by using specific inhibitors on CYP in the HLMs. The MCRs of MH were decreased to 29.1% and 41.3% of that of the control, respectively (). The results were further confirmed by the recombinant CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 experiment; after inhibiting the activities of the enzymes, the MCRs of MH were significantly decreased to 43.5% (MH, 10 M) and 60.5% (MH, 50 M) of that of the control for CYP1A2 and to 68.5% (MH, 10 M) and 80.5% (MH, 50 M) of that of the control for CYP2C19 (). The kinetics study indicated that the  and  values of MH were 10.31.3 M and 99.13.3 nmol/mg protein/min for the HLMs, 8.01.6 M and 112.45.7 nmol/nmol P450/min for CYP1A2 and 25.96.6 M and 134.312.4 nmol/nmol P450/min for CYP2C19, respectively (). CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 might be the major enzymes involved in the metabolism of MH .
