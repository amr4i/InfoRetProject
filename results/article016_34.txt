Optimal parcellation of the brain for the construction of connectivity estimates is a difficult problem. However, several innovative solutions exist. The Destrieux and Desikan reconstructions ,  can be generated automatically using FreeSurfer and divide the cortical surface into parcels based on macroscopic cytoarchitectonic and gyral profiles. These parcellations have been further subdivided into finer regions in order to generate 998 regions of roughly equal size . As the spatial scale of parcellation is thought to affect the topology of the network, , these 998 regions were subsequently reassembled into several parcellations of varying scale, containing 998, 483, 241, 133, and 66 nodes respectively , which are available from the open source Connectome mapper . These parcellations, registered to the FreeSurfer average brain fsaverage5, are included with CVU for convenience.
