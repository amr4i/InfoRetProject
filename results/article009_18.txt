In a forward mutagenesis screen we have identified a mutant which eliminates the activity of the zebrafish  gene. We show that  is expressed maternally and uniformly zygotically. The  zygotic mutant phenotype becomes progressively more severe as maternal Cnot8 activity declines.  expression analysis reveals that the mRNAs for a subset of neuronal differentiation markers, developmental transcription factors, and signals can be detected with elevated signal intensities in  mutant embryos.  as marker for dopaminergic neurons is enhanced in several DA neuronal groups, and the number of caudal hypothalamic DA neurons is significantly increased in  mutants. Analysis of the FGF signaling pathway in  mutants reveals that stabilization of  mRNA and FGF receptors may control DA neuron number in the caudal hypothalamus. Using Fgf3 loss-of-function experiments, we confirm that Fgf3 contributes to control of caudal hypothalamic DA neuron number.
