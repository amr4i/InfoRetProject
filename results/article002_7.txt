To create the P-GFP transcriptional fusion, 373 base pairs upstream (5) of the  start codon were cloned from the genome of  serovar Typhimurium LT2 to capture the putative P promoter, and placed into a pPROTET plasmid (Clontech). Downstream (3) of the P promoter,  mutant 2 , containing its own Shine-Dalgarno sequence and start codon, was inserted to serve as a fluorescent reporter. The P promoter region was PCR amplified from the  serovar Typhimurium LT2 genome using primers CMJ 091 and CMJ 097 (see Table S1 in ), and  mutant 2 was amplified using primers CMJ 038 and CMJ 096. The vector backbone was PCR amplified from a pPROTET plasmid to introduce BsaI restriction sites using primers CMJ 094 and CMJ 095. These three amplicons were assembled to construct the P-GFP transcriptional fusion plasmid by Golden Gate assembly .
