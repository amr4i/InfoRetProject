Countries implementing VL testing in resourcelimited settings will need guidance on acceptable time and temperature thresholds for sample transport, particularly in hot climates. Given that the studies included in this systematic review indicate that stability at extended time and temperature thresholds is greater than current recommendations indicate, we recommend that suppliers of EDTA tubes and PPT, as well as viral load tests, urgently undertake the necessary studies to allow for more flexible sample transport recommendations.

Some of these studies are not sufficiently powered to assess significance at 95% confidence at particular timepoints. Much of this variability may be attributed to variation across viral loads in patient samples, rather than over time. As only aggregate data was available, a matched pair comparison of differences in HIV RNA stability over time was not possible, thus confidence intervals around the point estimates are conservative estimates.

The majority of included studies were published prior to 2000 and the Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor was the most utilized VL assay. While the age of these studies would not impact the RNA stability, newer VL technologies may better detect RNA and could narrow the RNA degradation gap. Our study did not incorporate the variability in precision between VL assays, although these have been documented . For example, the new Roche COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 v2.0 assay has been reported to overestimate HIV RNA levels in plasma compared to other technologies . Most studies were adequately powered to account for these low-magnitude variations.
