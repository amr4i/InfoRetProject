All published studies show that HIV RNA has an extended time and temperature stability compared to current product labelling. Further studies are needed to determine the precise threshold of expansion and to correlate possible time and temperature-induced increases on HIV RNA at low VLs, especially with the newest VL technologies. This information is urgently needed in order to revise sample transport guidelines and facilitate the expansion of HIV VL monitoring in low- and middle-income countries.
