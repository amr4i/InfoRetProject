Recent research has focused on characterization of the infection process of , identification of pathotoxins and virulence genes in the fungus, and development of the fungal infection detection and monitoring methods, including chemical staining and fluorescent protein markers. Using GFP-tagged , it was observed that the potential invasion sites in banana are the epidermal cells of root caps and elongation zones as well as wounded lateral root bases .  produces several toxins, such as fusaric acid and beauvericin, during the growth and infection stages , . Several of the virulence genes and transcription factors show to be related to Fusarium wilt are involved in signal transduction, defense responses, and colonization .
