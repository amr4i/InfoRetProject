Given the pronounced changes in CA differentiation, we determined whether living  mutant larvae also develop morphological abnormalities. On the first and second day of development, the overall live morphology of  mutant embryos appear indistinguishable from wild-type siblings (data not shown). From 3 dpf on,  mutant embryos have smaller heads with smaller brain and eyes, as well as impaired branchial arch development. In 5 dpf old  mutant larvae, the eyes are significantly smaller than in wild-type siblings, and edema formation was observed in several tissues including the eyes, brain, heart sack, yolk sack and the intestine (). In addition,  mutants have defective swim bladder formation and reduced heart beat frequency. Further,  mutant larvae from 4 dpf on have a reduced motility in comparison to wild-type sibling larvae (data not shown). Mutant larvae die soon after 5 dpf and cannot be raised to feeding larvae.
