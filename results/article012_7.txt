PBMCs were analyzed by FACS as previously described . Peripheral whole blood was collected from each wild-type and -deficient newborn piglet and immediately transferred to a collection tube supplemented with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to prevent coagulation. Gradient centrifugation was used to separate PBMCs. After PBMCs were washed with PBS, they were stained for 30 min at 4C using a phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-porcine CD3 antibody (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-human CD19 antibody (Affimetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples were analyzed on a flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Flanklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
