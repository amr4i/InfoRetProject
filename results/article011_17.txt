The detailed interaction of CFS-1686 at site 1 is shown in . The positively charged guanidinio side chain of Arg364 anchors the CFS1686 carbonyl oxygen atom through hydrogen bonding, and the nitro group points toward top1 Lys439 for a hydrogen bond formation. Meanwhile, an additional hydrogen bond is formed between the nitrogen atom of the CFS1686 quinoline group and the Tyr723 hydroxyl oxygen atom. The docking score of CFS1686 is 74. Altogether, it is the nitro group that can interact with both Lys443 and Lys587 simultaneously or merely Lys439 as an essential structural element to maintain the studied compound's potency at this docking site. To examine this necessity, we docked compounds 5, 6, 7, 8, and 16  to this site. Their docking scores as well as that of CFS1686 are listed in . Compounds 5, 6, 7, and 8 were drawn into the package and prepared as CFS-1686. As expected, compounds 5, 6, 7, and 8, which lack a nitro group, have lower docking scores ranging from 32 to 40, whereas both 16 and CFS-1686 carrying a nitro group have better scores, 62 and 74 respectively.
