and  report the characteristics of all patients and echocardiography data in the derivation cohort. First, we did a univariate analysis and found that initial contact age, defect diameter, ATVMS formation, diffuse shunt flow, associated complication and increased LVDD were significantly associated with prognosis in the derivation cohort. Next, input variables were evaluated by forward stepwise Cox regression analysis as being significant factors that contribute independently to the prognosis of PMVSD. All the input variables were considered as independent predictors for SC ().
