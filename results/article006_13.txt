According to our analysis, initial contact age, defect diameter, diffuse shunt flow, ATVMS formation, associated complication and increased LVDD yielded the best prediction model for SC of PMVSD. In the published literature, defect size has been considered as the major determinant of SC of isolated VSD . Shirali et al.  developed a model in which the indexed VSD cross-sectional area indicated a high probability of SC (0.5 cm/m) or surgery (1.0 cm/m). Our findings are consistent with these studies, in that defect diameters 0.30 cm had a much higher probability of SC than larger ones.
