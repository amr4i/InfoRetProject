We next examined the distribution of the 99 identified proteins in different fungal species and found that 46 of the proteins from F4 and 17 from F1 could be identified. On the other hand, 24 of the proteins were also found in  Fo5176, four proteins were seen in other  varieties, and eight proteins showed high similarity to proteins in other fungal species (; ). The 99 proteins were further classified into 11 groups based on their main cellular functions (). Among the 82 proteins to which functions could be assigned, the largest group were involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism (CTM), followed by the posttranslational modification (PTM)-related chaperones, inorganic ion transport and metabolism (ITM)-related proteins, amino acid metabolism (ATM) and energy production and conversion (EPC). A relatively small proportion of the proteins is involved in coenzyme metabolism (COM), DNA replication, recombination and repair (DRR), transcription, translation, ribosome structure and biogenesis (TRR), and cell motility and secretion (CMS). Function could not be assigned to the remaining 17 proteins (; ).
