In contrast to the simple homo-oligomeric structures found in , chloroplast chaperonins are unique in three aspects: 1) Chloroplasts harbor duplicated chaperonin and co-chaperonin genes. For example, chloroplasts generally contain two chaperonin subtypes, Cpn60 and Cpn60. They also harbor two structurally distinct co-chaperonin proteins, the gene of one (cpn10) which encodes for a 10 kDa subunit, and the gene of the second (cpn20), which consists of two homologous cpn10 sequences joined head-to-tail. 2) Often, greater than one gene for each subtype is present in the genome. 3) Both chaperonin and co-chaperonin subunits can assemble into a variety of functional homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes. Cpn60 hetero-oligomer is the most abundant oligomeric form  (reviewed in ), although the Cpn60 subunits were shown to be functional as homo-oligomers  . In terms of co-chaperonins, Cpn10 and Cpn20 can function  as heptameric and tetrameric homo-oligomers, respectively . In addition, hetero-oligomers of Cpn20 and Cpn10 were shown to form and be functional  .
