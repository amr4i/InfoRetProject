Since activin regulation of  transcription involves both SMADs and FOXL2, we sought to characterize the mechanism that FOXO1 employs to repress activin signaling in gonadotropes. We demonstrated that the region between 304 and 95, which contains several SMAD and FOXL2 binding elements, is necessary for the FOXO1 repression (). We then showed that two mutations (W209G and H215L) in helix 3 of the FOXO1 DBD prevented FOXO1 from eliciting a repressive effect (). H215 has been shown to make DNA contacts through hydrogen-bonding and water-mediated interactions  but the role of these two residues in protein-protein interactions is unknown. Our data suggests that the FOXO1 DBD is necessary for FOXO1 repression because FOXO1 binds directly to the  promoter or because FOXO1 forms protein-protein interactions with factors critical for activin induction of  transcription via the FOXO1 DBD.
