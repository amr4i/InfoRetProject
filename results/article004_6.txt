Kinetic analysis was performed for MH, and the data generated were used as a guide for selecting the appropriate concentrations of MH in the subsequent inhibition experiments. Thus, the kinetic parameters for the metabolism of MH was determined by incubating increasing concentrations of MH (0.5100 M) (without the inhibitor) at 37C with the HLMs and NADPH under the incubation conditions. The equation of MH reaction velocity () in the HLMs or CYP isoforms was expressed as T, where  and  represented the initial and final concentrations of MH in the incubation solution, respectively. T was the incubation time (min) and  was the protein concentration (mg/mL or nmol). All values were expressed as the meanstandard deviation (SD). The mean intrinsic clearance rate () for the  incubation was estimated using .
