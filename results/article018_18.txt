Binding of LPS brings CD14, MD-2 and TLR4 in close proximity, thereby forming the LPS receptor complex . Formation and activation of this complex results in docking of different adapter molecules, which induces a first wave of NF-kB activation , . Whereas CD14 binds the carbohydrate portion of LPS and is thus mainly involved in LPS recognition , TLR4 acts as the main signalling receptor for LPS . To analyse whether the high LPS sensitivity of monocytes and especially CD1c DCs was related to the expression of CD14 and/or TLR4, we compared the expression of both surface molecules on all four cell types. Whereas in monocytes and CD1c DCs TLR4 is hardly detectable, a major fraction of both cell types expresses CD14, which is significantly down-regulated with increasing concentrations of LPS. In contrast, THP1 cells and moDCs express TLR4 on their surface, but lack substantial CD14 expression (). Although a minor population of freshly isolated, blood-derived human CD1c DCs was previously shown to express CD14 , , the high number of CD14-expressing CD1c DCs observed in our experimental setup was rather unexpected. Because we monitored CD14 expression 24 h after cell isolation, we cultured CD1c DCs in medium for 24 h and compared CD14 expression to cells that have been freshly isolated. In line with previous studies , , only a minor fraction of CD1c DCs was found to express CD14 immediately after cell isolation, whereas CD14 expression was drastically increased after culturing the cells in DC-medium for 24 h ().
