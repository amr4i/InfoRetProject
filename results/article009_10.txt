Given that the most severe dopaminergic phenotype was observed in the caudal hypothalamus, we analyzed expression of transcription factors involved in dopaminergic differentiation and in hypothalamic development.  and  have been shown to encode transcription factors required for the specification and differentiation of a subset of DA neurons in the ventral diencephalon in zebrafish , . At 2 dpf,  is expressed in several ventral diencephalic domains within the dorsal posterior tuberculum, hypothalamus, and ventral pituitary . In  mutant embryos  is expressed in the same spatial pattern but at stronger WISH signal intensity as compared to wild-type siblings (; preoptic domain not significantly different, but hindbrain WISH signal significantly stronger, p = 0.008). At 3 dpf expression levels of  decline and the corresponding domains in the posterior tuberculum and hypothalamus are very faint in wild-type siblings, while  WISH signal in these domains is detected at higher levels in  mutants (; preoptic area p = 0004). The  expression domain in the hindbrain also has a stronger WISH stain in  mutants embryos compared to wild-type siblings (hindbrain p = 0.002). Expression analysis of  at 2 dpf also revealed a slightly stronger staining in  mutant embryos in comparison to wild-type siblings, while the expression pattern was normal (; posterior tuberculum p = 0.004). We further analyzed  expression as a marker for the hypothalamus . The analysis revealed that at 3 dpf the hypothalamus in  mutant embryos and wild-type siblings are of equal size (). However, we observed a slightly stronger  WISH signal in  mutant embryos as compared to wild-type siblings (hypothalamus p = 0.008). In summary, it appears that patterning and regionalization of the brain occur normally in  mutant embryos, while, as judged from WISH stain intensities, the transcript levels of some genes, including the transcription factors , and , appear to be increased.
