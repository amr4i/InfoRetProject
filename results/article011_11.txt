We investigated whether CFS-1686-induced cell cycle arrest at the intra-S phase was due to DNA damage. The master regulators of DNA damage are ATM and ATR . Since CPT, by causing a DNA double strand break, activates ATM by auto-phosphorylation on Ser1981 to initiate cell cycle arrest and DNA repair , we asked if CFS-1686 or CPT could increase the level of ATM auto-phosphorylation. Western blotting analysis with a specific antibody against P-Ser1981 of ATM demonstrated that ATM auto-phosphorylation resulted and reached saturation within 1 hr after CPT treatment, whereas auto-phosphorylation in cells treated by CFS-1686 was slight after 1 hr and progressed toward saturation after 4 hr ().
