Functional analysis by COG revealed that approximately half of the F4-specific proteins are involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism, including glucanosyltransferase, galactosidase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, and chitinase. Many F4 proteins are also involved in inorganic ion transport and metabolism (8 isoforms of catalase-peroxidase), energy production and conversion (4 isoforms of ATP synthase and one glutathione reductase), and posttranslational modification related chaperones (). Molecular function analysis revealed that most of these proteins such as catalase-peroxidase and glucanosyltransferase, have catalytic activity, followed by cation ion binding (glucanosyltransferase, chitinase and enolase), heme binding (catalase-peroxidase), and kinase activity (phosphoglycerate kinase and adenosine kinase). Another six proteins were identified as enzymes involved in ATP binding or hydrogen ion transporting ATP synthase activity. The results obtained from both the GO analysis and COG classification of the 99 differential proteins revealed that enzymes related to carbohydrate metabolism, ion transporting and energy production might play important role in the F4 induced banana wilt.
