To investigate the strong pathogenicity of F4, Li  isolated the mutant gene  from F4. This gene has 48% sequence similarly with the rice homology and encodes an ABC transporter responsible for pumping toxin out of the fungal cell during the pathogenic process . Chen  cloned  gene from F4, which encodes a transcription factor important for regulation of biosynthesis of enniatin and beauvericin . Our proteomic data demonstrate that almost all of the identified F4 proteins (40 of 46) are functional enzymes (). One of these enzymes, the cell wallanchored glycoside hydrolase -1-3-glucanosyltransferase, can directly affect fungal physiology . Inactivation of a glucanosyltransferase in  results in a reduced virulence in tomato , , whereas deletion of a similar gene in the maize rot fungus of  affects conidiation and cell wall structure but not virulence . The glucanosyltransferase gene  knockout mutant shows reduced virulence in  . Also in  mutation of a glucanosyltransferase gene resulted in slow growth, abnormal conidiogenesis, and low virulence .
