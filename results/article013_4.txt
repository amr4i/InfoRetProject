To examine the anti-inflammatory activity of gentian root extracts, we investigated their ability to inhibit LPS-induced expression of TNF- in RAW264.7 cells. TNF- mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated at 4 hours after treating the cells with LPS. This upregulation was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the root extracts ().
