The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Shanghai Jiaotong University and written informed consent was obtained from all parents. We included 2255 PMVSD patients who met the inclusion criteria in this study. Inclusion criteria were: 1) careful echocardiographic examinations; 2) integrated follow-up data; 3) presence of an isolated PMVSD determined by the clinical features and diagnostics evaluation  or PMVSD and additional heart abnormalities that did not obviously affect VSD hemodynamically , including  an open foramen ovale or a small secundum aerial septal defect,  a small patent ductus arteriosus, and  a persistent left superior vena cava. Exclusion criteria were multiple ventricular septal defects and complicated cardiac malformations, such as tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, and truncus arteriosus. In the first part of our analysis, a derivative data set from 1873 PMVSD patients who first contacted Shanghai Xinhua Hospital between September 2001 and December 2009 was collected and used to develop a predictive scoring system for PMVSD SC (derivative patient group). In the second part of the study, the scoring system was then applied for 382 patients, who were admitted to the hospital between January and December 2010, in order to validate the derived scoring system (validation patient group, ).
