To further understand the host-pathogen interaction mechanisms, global changes in gene expressions upon pathogen invasion has been examined and some signaling components identified , . However, quantitative mRNA data do not, necessarily, reflect the protein expression patterns. Conversely, protein abundance does not always correlate with mRNA level, particularly for certain low-abundance proteins. Moreover, many proteins undergo post-translational modifications that are important for their enzyme activity and subcellular localization . Therefore, it is necessary to use proteome-based expression profiling to study plantpathogen interactions. Recently, several fungal proteomics studies have analyzed the differentially expressed proteins upon fungal infection , , . To our knowledge, no comparative proteomics study of the different races of  has been performed. Based on the borax/PVPP/phenol protocol  and improved Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 staining method , we optimized the protein extraction protocol for  and obtained highquality two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) profiles of F1 . Here, we further performed comparative proteomics of F1 and F4 under different culture conditions and positively identified 99 differentially expressed proteins. These results provide insights that will be useful toward further investigations of the detailed molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of Fusarium wilt.
