The limited sample transport time and temperature thresholds effectively limit the radius of whole blood transport to 6 hours at 25C or to 24 hours at 4C. The implications of such cautious labelling would not significantly affect care in developed countries, since maintaining the cold chain is less difficult, and there is widespread access to centrifuges and efficient specimen transport services. However, in resource-poor environments, such restrictive guidance on whole blood and plasma transport greatly limits access to VL testing to only those in close proximity to national or regional laboratories. This systematic review seeks to measure HIV RNA stability in EDTA tubes and PPT at extended time and temperature thresholds, compared to the established thresholds, in all published studies.
