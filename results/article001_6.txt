After an initial title search, selected abstracts were reviewed in duplicate using piloted forms. Any disagreements were resolved with a third reviewer. The same procedure was followed for inclusion of full text articles and data extraction. Articles were included if they measured HIV RNA stability beyond the established time and temperature thresholds for whole blood or plasma with either EDTA tubes or PPT. Extracted information included characteristics of the study, population, intervention, outcome and risk of bias. Recommended time and temperature thresholds include: <6 hours at room temperature (defined as 25C) for whole blood in EDTA tubes or PPT and <24 hours in whole blood in EDTA at 4C. Plasma can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature (defined as 25C) in EDTA tubes or 5 days at 4C for EDTA tubes or PPT.
