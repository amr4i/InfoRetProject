Gentian roots and rhizomes have traditionally been used in Europe and western Asia as herbal medicines because of their anti-inflammatory effects. Most studies of these properties have therefore been performed using European and Chinese gentian roots ,. In this study, we demonstrated for first time that roots of the Japanese gentian,  (which was first isolated from  in 1978; ), also have anti-inflammatory activity. We identified gentiolactone as the major active compound contained in the root extracts of . Wang  (2013) revealed that the inhibitory activity of gentiolactone on nitric oxide production was weaker than gentiopicroside ; to our knowledge, this is the only report on the bioactivity of gentiolactone. Here, we showed that gentiolactone prevents accumulation of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines, TNF-, and pro-inflammatory enzymes iNOS and Cox-2. Moreover, gentiolactone inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-B. Therefore, inhibition of TNF-, iNOS and Cox-2 mRNA expression and suppression of NF-B promoter activity by gentiolactone is one of the mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory properties of gentian roots.
