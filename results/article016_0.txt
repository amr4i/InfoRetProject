A foremost aspiration in neuroscience is understanding the connectivity of the human brain. Recent years have seen considerable growth of interest in the human connectome, the effort to map the entire connectivity of the human brain. The analysis of this high-dimensional connectivity data presents a particularly challenging problem. The emerging field of connectomics has risen to meet this challenge, leveraging new advances in graph theory to understand human brain function and leading to the development of multi-institution initiatives such as the Human Connectome project .
