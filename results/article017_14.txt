LT2 cells were incubated overnight in serum-free media and then treated with or without 10 ng/mL activin for 2 hours. The cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were prepared, as previously described . Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. 400 g of pre-cleared nuclear extracts were incubated with 4 g of mouse IgG (Santa Cruz sc-2025), SMAD4 antibody (sc-7966) or SMAD2/3 antibody (BD Biosciences 610842) at 4C for 1 hour. Twenty-five L of Protein A Magnetic Beads (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) were added and the extracts were rocked overnight at 4C. Bead/protein complexes were washed 1 with PBS then eluted in 2 SDS sample buffer at 70C for 5 minutes. 20 g of protein was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked overnight in 5% non-fat dry milk in 1 Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4C with rabbit anti-SMAD4 (Millipore 04-1033; 1:1000 dilution), SMAD2/3 (sc-8332; 1:1000) or FOXO1 (sc-11350, 1:1000 dilution) primary antibodies. Blots were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Santa Cruz; 1:5000) and bands were visualized using the SuperSignal West Dura Substrate (Thermo Scientific).
