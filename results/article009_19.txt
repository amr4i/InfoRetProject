Cnot8 is a component of the Ccr4-Not complex which is conserved from yeast to human and considered to be a platform to regulate gene expression at different levels, including bulk mRNA degradation, protein ubiquitination, and transcription , . While biochemical and cellular functions of the complex have been extensively characterized in cell lines and invertebrate model organisms, little is known whether Ccr4-Not or its subunits may contribute to tissue specific mRNA turnover or regulatory mechanisms in vertebrates. In mice, Cnot8 has been shown to contribute to proper spermatogenesis , revealing a potential for selective Cnot8 activity in development and differentiation. In this work we characterized the zebrafish  mutant allele which contains a premature stop codon in the ORF after amino acid 27, likely resulting in a null allele. The Cnot8 protein contains only one functional domain which is required for exonuclease activity and a truncation of the protein likely impedes deadenylation of bulk mRNA resulting in accumulation of transcripts. Proper Ccr4-Not complex function is substantial and necessary as only completely deadenylated transcripts are degraded and no longer translated. Our data suggest that Cnot8, similar to Caf1 in  and POP2 in , has a function in mRNA turnover in zebrafish.
