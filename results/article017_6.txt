LT2 cells were seeded at 4.510 cells/well on 12-well plates and transfected 18 hours later, using PolyJet DNA  Transfection Reagent (SignaGen, Rockville, MD), following the manufacturer's instructions. For all experiments, the cells were transfected for 6 hours with 400 ng of the indicated luc reporter plasmid and 200 ng of a -galactosidase (-gal) reporter plasmid driven by the Herpes Virus thymidine kinase promoter to control for transfection efficiency. The cells were switched to serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, 5 mg/L transferrin and 50 mM sodium selenite 6 hours after transfection. After overnight incubation in serum-free media, the cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% BSA) or 10 ng/mL activin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 6 hours.
