Risk of bias was estimated for each study according to a modified Jadad scale adapted for basic science . Risk of bias was then summarized according to the GRADE framework , .

The primary outcome measured was mean log declines in RNA stability beyond recommended time and temperature thresholds, with significant declines in RNA stability reported as a secondary outcome. Data was analyzed by mean VL differences at different temperature thresholds. Mean and standard errors were calculated from median and range when not otherwise provided . When not provided in the study, standard deviation of the difference in means was imputed using the Cochrane Handbook methodology and the coefficients of correlation provided among the included studies . Corresponding authors were contacted for any additional information needed.

A viral degradation cutoff of > 0.5 log copies/mL was used to define clinical significance, consistent with the literature , . Figures were developed to chart RNA stability over time by transport type at specific temperature thresholds, with lines of best fit generated using Stata 13.

The database search yielded 10,716 unique titles (); 60 articles were reviewed in full text and nine studies were taken through for review. Characteristics of selected studies are outlined in .
