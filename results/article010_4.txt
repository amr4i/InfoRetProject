Each filter was transferred into a plastic jar with the particle collection side facing downwards, and then leached with 15-mL Milli-Q water (18.5 Mcm) in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min at room temperature. After ultrasonication, the leachate was filtered through a PTFE syringe filter (Fisher brand, 0.22 m) before being introduced into an ion chromatography system (ICS-2000, Thermo Fisher). An AS19 analytical column (4250 mm, Thermo Fisher), KOH eluent generator cartridge (EGC II KOH, Thermo Fisher) and 50-L sample loop were employed for the determinations of anions, which included F, Cl, NO, and SO. The cations of interest, Na, NH, K, Ca, and Mg, were determined with the same IC system with a CS12A analytical column (4250 mm, Thermo Fisher), a 50-L sample loop and MSA (EGC II MSA, Thermo Fisher) as the eluent. The above-mentioned anions and cations were considered to be the total water-soluble ions in this study. The detection limit for major anions, including F, Cl, NO, SO, Na, NH, K, Ca, and Mg, was <2 g/L. The recovery fell in the range 81107%, and the precision based on seven duplicate spike samples was 3%.
