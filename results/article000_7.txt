Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 Software (San Diego, USA). The results from microbiological cell enumeration and either qPCR or EMA-qPCR, and results from fluorescence microscopy were statistically analysed using one-way ANOVA with independent variables as the isolation method (membrane filtration, centrifugation) or water type (pond water, tap water). If the F-statistic was significant (<0.05), the Dunett's multiple comparison post-hoc test or Tukey's multiple comparison post-hoc test for repeated measurements was subsequently applied, considering a significance level of 0.05. To assess the relationship between culture-based enumeration and qPCR results, a Pearson correlation analysis was performed. For method comparisons, the Bland-Altman analysis was used.
