The inhibitory effect of CPT and CFS-1686 on supercoiled DNA strand breakage caused by TopI was evaluated. Plasmid pUC19 DNA (200 ng) was incubated at 37C for 30 min in a reaction solution (40 mM Tris-acetate, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM EDTA; pH 7.5) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of inhibitors in a final volume of 20 l. The conversion of the covalently closed circular double-stranded supercoiled DNA to a relaxed form was used to evaluate DNA strand breakage induced by TopI. Samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel, and electrophoresis was performed in TAE buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate and 1 mM EDTA). The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 g/mL) for 5 min, then photographed under transmitted ultraviolet light.
