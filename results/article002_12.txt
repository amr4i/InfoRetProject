We used two methods to verify that activation of the transcriptional reporter correlates with the formation of MCPs. First, we applied another fluorescence-based system in which the first 18 amino acids of the MCP-encapsulated enzyme PduP are fused to GFP to create an MCP-encapsulated fluorescent reporter (Pdu-GFP). As previously reported, punctate fluorescence was observed by microscopy when  concurrently express this encapsulation reporter and Pdu MCPs ,  (), indicating localization of the reporter fusion to Pdu MCPs. In a microscopy time course, we first observed cells with one or more fluorescent puncta within two hours after addition of 1,2-PD (2.5% of cells, n = 79), showing agreement with flow cytometry results (see Fig. S2 in ). The proportion of cells with fluorescent puncta increased over time until we observed that nearly all cells contained at least one fluorescent puncta after six hours (95.2% of cells, n = 104).
