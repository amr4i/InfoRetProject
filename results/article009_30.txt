Counts of  and DA cells were performed visually using DIC transmitted light image stacks documenting the regions of the brain in which dopaminergic neurons are located. Cell counts were performed using ImageJ or Zeiss ZEN software. For all cell count analyses (, , ), cell numbers of 5 embryos for each experimental condition were determined. The numbers reported in the bar graphs are average numbers determined using the Microsoft Excel "Average" function, and plotted with standard deviation calculated by Microsoft Excel. Statistical analyses were performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test by the statistical analysis software GraphPad Prism version 6.0d for MacOS, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, .
