Flag-FOXO1-CA was transcribed and translated using a TnT Coupled Reticulolysate System (Promega). The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [-P] ATP. 4 L of TnT lysate was incubated with 1 fmol of P-labeled oligo at 4C for 30 min in a DNA-binding buffer [10 mM Hepes pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 g poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol]. After 30 min, the DNA binding reactions were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide) containing 2.5% glycerol in a 0.25 TBE buffer. Murine Flag M2 (Sigma-Aldrich F1804) antibody was used for supershift; murine IgG was used as a control for non-specific binding. The following oligonucleotides were used for EMSA: 305/271 , 275/241 , 245/211 , 215/181 , 185/151 , 155/121 , 125/91 , and the consensus FBE  .
