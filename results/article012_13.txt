Spleens, MLNs, and thymuses were histologically investigated by H&E staining (). In wild-type neonatal piglets, spleens clearly possessed white pulp, clusters of lymphocytes had formed around the central artery (), and numerous lymphoid follicles were evident in MLNs (). In contrast, the white pulp of the spleen and lymphoid follicles of MLNs were unclear and virtually devoid of small lymphocytes in  neonatal piglets (). Likewise, in wild-type piglets, the lobules of the thymus consisted of cortex and medulla and many lymphocytes were extant in the cortex region (). On the other hand, there was no division between the cortex and medulla in the lobules of the thymus in  piglets, and polygonal cells with irregular nuclei and large cytoplasm existed in the gaps between interdigitating reticulum cells (). These polygonal cells were similar to cells observed in the spleens and MLNs of -deficient pigs and exhibited morphologic characteristics reminiscent of immature lymphocytes.
