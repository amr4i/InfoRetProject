To investigate the ion enrichment of the different sizes of particulate matter, a further study was conducted in Beijing. We collected and analyzed PM, PM, PM and total suspended particulate matters (TSP).  shows the concentrations of nine ions in particulate matter of different sizes. The smaller diameter particulate matter contained the highest concentration of soluble ions. For example, >56% of the water-soluble ions were distributed in PM, compared to <10% in particles with a diameter>10 m. Small particulate matter was more capable of carrying K. While Cl, Mg, and Ca were present at higher concentrations in the larger sizes of particulate matter. Thus, controlling small particulate matter would substantially reduce the concentration of water-soluble ions in the atmosphere.
