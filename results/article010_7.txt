Significant seasonal variation in the water-soluble compositions of PM and PM were identified in each city (). In spring, autumn and winter, the ions exhibited a similar concentration distribution, with the exception of a minor difference in SO in PM during spring. The order of the total ion concentrations in the three cities was Shijiazhuang> Tianjin> Beijing. The SO concentration in spring in the PM of Tianjin was slightly higher than that of Shijiazhuang. However, an inverse distribution was found in the summer. The ion concentrations of Shijiazhuang were lower than those of Beijing and Tianjin. During the sampling period, the average PM and PM concentrations by mass of the whole studied region were 167 and 273 g/m, respectively. The concentrations of water-soluble ions in both PM and PM displayed a significant variation with season, in the order spring> winter> summer> autumn. This might be explained by the high proportion of coal burning for heating in spring and winter, and the frequent dust storms in spring .
