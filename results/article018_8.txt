1.210 HEK293 cells per well in 500 l antibiotics-free DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich; supplemented with 10% i.a. FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 2 mM MEM non-essential amino acids) were plated in 24-well plates. After 24 h, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Lofer, Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, per well, 500 ng DNA and 1.5 l of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent were diluted in 25 l of Opti-MEM (Gibco). As DNA, an NF-B Luciferase reporter (kindly provided by Min Li-Weber  and cloned into pGL3Neo in our laboratory) and a TLR4-CD14-MD2 mix was used in a ratio of 4:1. The mix consists of expression plasmids for TLR4 (in pCDNA3), CD14 (in pCDNA3) and MD-2 (in pEFBOS) (kind gifts from Andrei Medvedev and Douglas Golenbock) in a ratio of 3:1:1. Both reactions were mixed, pooled and incubated for 5 min at room temperature (RT). The transfection mix was then added to the wells. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% i.a. FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 1x MEM (2 mM) non-essential amino acids). Cells were then induced with the appropriate stimuli. After 20 h of induction, supernatants were discarded and 100 l of lysis buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT) was added to each well. The lysates were transferred to white polystyrene flat-bottom microtitre plates in duplicates. Luciferase activity was measured in a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro microplate reader, where 50 l of luciferase substrate was added using an automated dispenser.
