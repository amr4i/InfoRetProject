Limitations of our study include the fact that the defect size was measured by 2D echocardiography, resulting in lower accuracy, due to the circular VSD shape. In addition, the model does not include clinical information like X-ray, EKG variables, or the effects of medications such as diuretics, which may have an influence on SCs. Finally, the scoring system needs longer follow-up to validate its feasibility. Not all patients with high probability according to their score had a SC at the last visit, indicating that the scoring system just provides complementary clinical information, which might help the pediatrician to make predictions about their future status, but it cannot provide an exact prognosis. All information, including clinical manifestation, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and the scores discussed above should be considered together to predict the outcome of a patient with PMVSD. Close follow-up of all patients is also recommended.
