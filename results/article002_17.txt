We next set out to use PocR to directly control MCP formation. We tested the effects of PocR on P promoter activation by monitoring fluorescence from the P-GFP transcriptional fusion plasmid upon heterologous expression of PocR from a secondary, aTc-inducible pTET-based plasmid. In  grown in LB, expression of PocR by addition of 1 ng/mL aTc resulted in increased fluorescence even in the absence of 1,2-PD, while strains carrying a negative control vector encoding for maltose-binding protein (MBP) showed no shift in fluorescence (, see also Fig. S6 in ). When PocR was overexpressed in combination with the addition of 1,2-PD, we observed a higher fluorescence shift than induction by either 1,2-PD or PocR expression alone (, see also Fig. S6 in ). Fluorescence microscopy of strains co-expressing PocR and encapsulation reporter PduP-GFP showed punctate fluorescence, while strains expressing PduP-GFP and carrying the MBP control vector showed diffuse fluorescence (). In the case of  grown in the presence of glucose, we observed that heterologous expression of PocR restored activation of the P promoter both in the presence and absence of 1,2-PD (see Fig. S4 in ). In this case, fluorescence microscopy could not be used to track MCP formation for strains expressing PduP-GFP due to catabolite repression by glucose of the pBAD induction system.
