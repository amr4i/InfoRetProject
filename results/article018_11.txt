Total RNA from cells was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and reverse transcribed with RevertAid H Minus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on a Rotorgene 3000 (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Vienna, Austria) and the primers listed below. The large ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0) was used as a reference. Specificity was controlled by recording a melting curve for the PCR products. Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the formula x = 2, where Ct represents the threshold cycle of a given gene and Ct signifies the difference between the Ct values of the gene in question and the Ct value of the reference gene.
