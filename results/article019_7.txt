The analgesic activity of compounds  and the  mixture was compared to that of paracetamol and morphine in a model of visceral pain (). The intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of acetic acid (2%) induced a typical writhing reaction, characterized by a wave of contraction of the abdominal musculature followed by extension of the hind limbs. After acetic acid administration, mice were placed in individual transparent containers and, after 5 min, the number of writhes was counted during a 10 min period. In nave animals, the number of stretches induced by acetic acid was 25.40.8. Morphine (5 mg/kg, i.p.), an opioid accepted as the gold standard of analgesic drugs, notably decreased the number of writhes by 75%. Paracetamol (100 mg/kg), administered i.p. 30 minutes before acetic acid, was less effective than morphine reducing only by 40% the nociceptic behavior. Furthermore, a 2-fold increment in the paracetamol dose did not result in an increase of its analgesic effect in this pain model ().
