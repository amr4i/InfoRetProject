All pigs of this study were raised in a specific pathogen free (SPF) environment.  matured oocytes were collected from estrus-synchronized and superovulated gilts and sows treated with equine chorionic gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin (Novartis Animal Health Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with/without prostaglandin F (Asuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as described previously . Oocytes were removed from cumulus cells in 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA). Enucleation and SCNT were performed using a procedure based on blind methods using a piezo-actuated system (PRIME TECH LTD., Ibaraki, Japan) previously described . Oocytes injected with donor cells were electrically activated by a single direct current pulse at 1.5 kV/cm for 100 s. Reconstructed embryos were transferred into porcine zygote medium-3 (PZM-3) supplemented with 5 g/ml cytochalasin B (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA), and after a 2 h incubation at 38.5C in 5% CO, 5% O, and 90% N, the embryos were cultured in PZM-3 until embryo transfer . Reconstructed embryos with clear cytoplasts were selected and surgically transferred into the oviducts of estrus-synchronized recipient gilts. All the -deficient neonatal piglets produced during this research were euthanized, along with age-matched two wild-type piglets, for analysis.
