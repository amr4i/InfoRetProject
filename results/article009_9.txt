To identify whether pattern formation and morphogenesis of the brain proceed normally during the first three days of development, we investigated the expression of genes involved in pattern formation and regionalization of the brain in  mutant embryos. To determine whether changes in WISH signal may be significant, we measured mean intensities of WISH signal within defined anatomical domains of marker gene expression in five or more images of control and experimental (mutant) embryos, and analyzed data for significant differences in mean intensities using the Mann-Whitney test (see ; all measurements and statistical analyses are documented in ). We used  for telencephalic development ,  as a marker for rhombomeres 3 and 5  and  as a marker for prominent signaling centers like the mid-hindbrain boundary, anterior neural ridge and optic stalk . In 1 and 2 dpf old  mutant and wild-type sibling embryos the expression pattern of these genes was indistinguishable (). In contrast, at 3 dpf a slightly stronger WISH stain was observed for  and  in  mutant embryos compared to wild-type, while  expression appeared not affected. Measurements revealed that the WISH signal was significantly stronger in the telencephalic  domain at 3 dpf (p = 0.032), and at 2 dpf (p = 0.017) and 3 dpf (p = 0.009) for the hindbrain  domain.
