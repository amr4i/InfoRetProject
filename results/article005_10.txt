The modified lower and upper bounds of the flux ( and ) for each reaction respectively are obtained by replacing the original lower and upper bounds used in the baseline solution by the specific expression values (). By using this approach, reaction flux in either direction of reversible reactions is constrained according to major and minor reductions of the magnitude of baseline (). This allows flux to switch directions if subsequent FBA runs find this to be optimal. As a result for a reversible reaction, there exist 2 possible combinations of adjusted flux bounds (Minor-Minor, Minor-Major, Major-Minor and Major-Major) (). Similarly, for an irreversible reaction there exist 2 possible combinations (Major and Minor).
