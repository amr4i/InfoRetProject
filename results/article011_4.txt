About 510 cells/per well were seeded into 96-well plates. After 12 hr, the cells were incubated with 1 M of CPT (Sigma), 1 M of CFS-1686 or DMSO as a control. BrdU incorporation assays were performed using the BrdU cell proliferation kit (Roche). BrdU labelling and detection followed the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were pulsed with BrdU for 5 hr and then fixed and denatured, followed by immunodetection of BrdU incorporation Absorbance was measured at 370 nm.

The synchronized PC3 cells were incubated with 0.5 M of CPT, 0.5 M of CFS-1686 and DMSO as a control, respectively. The cells were harvested by trypsinization after compound treatments of 0 and 5 hr, centrifuged, washed with PBS and collected by centrifugation. The cells were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 min, washed with PBS and centrifuged to remove supernatant. The cells were re-suspended in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and RNAase A (40 g/mL) and incubated at 37C for 1 hr, and propidium iodide (PI) was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 50 g/mL for another 1 hr incubation. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS and centrifuged to remove supernatant. Finally, the cells were re-suspended in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with Software (BD Biosciences).
