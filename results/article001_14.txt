Our analysis indicates that HIV RNA is stable in EDTA tubes beyond the current manufacturer recommendations for time and temperature and highlights the need for more definitive studies at higher temperatures that may be encountered in countries with high HIV burdens. For EDTA whole blood transport, RNA remains stable until 72 hours, with data points at times beyond 72 hours suggesting stability, but with 95% confidence intervals that spanned the stability threshold. For EDTA plasma at 30C, measures of RNA were within the stability threshold at 48 hours. While a meta-regression suggested stability beyond 48 hours (estimated stability until 127 hours), no data points were available between 48 and 168 hours and one cannot assume linear RNA degradation under these conditions. More data is needed to confirm the true stability of EDTA plasma at 30C beyond 48 hours. These studies indicate that transport for both EDTA whole blood and plasma can potentially be greatly expanded, thus increasing the feasibility of transporting blood tubes to laboratories in resource limited settings.
