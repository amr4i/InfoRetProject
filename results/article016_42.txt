Interactive and flexible visualization is an important part of scientific discovery. Visualization can stimulate new hypotheses, allow researchers to quickly assess their findings at a glance, and serve as important quality control. As a network visualization tool, CVU performs all of these functions. In addition, CVU has novel interactive visualization features not available in existing software packages for visualization of the connectome such as the Connectome Viewer , such as the ability to interactively isolate connections to explore the network topology. CVU offers the ability to easily visualize network statistics. CVU can visualize modular partitions of brain networks, allowing comparisons to well-studied brain networks (e.g., default mode network, ventral attention network, etc.).
