For all binary variables, the presence of the variable is equivalent to 1, whereas the absence of the variable is equivalent to 0. For ATVMS formation, grade 0 is equivalent to 0, grade 1 is equivalent to 1, and grade 2 is equivalent to 2. For associated complication, absent is equivalent to 0, single is equivalent to 1, and multiple is equivalent to 2. For example, for a PMVSD patient with initial contact age of 6 months, VSD diameter of 0.3 cm, no associated complication (code 0), ATVMS formation of grade 2 (code 2), diffuse shunt flow (code 1), and increased LVDD (code 1), a is calculated as a = ([0.0546][2.6760.3][0.4131]+[0.8252][1.4420][0.3041])= 0.194, the 1-year probability of occurring SC is  = 0.209, and the 3-year probability of occurring SC is  = 0.677.
