Samples of genomic DNA were extracted from the original PFF (T6-12), heterozygous KO cells (#95-2,  PFF), and homozygous KO cells (#3-55,  PFF). Moreover, the tail tissues were obtained from the -deficient ( No. 1 and No. 2) and newborn wild-type piglets (WT No. 1 and No. 2) for genomic DNA extraction. Genomic PCR was employed to confirm -deficiency and the presence of targeting vector transgenes (). The targeting vector transgene was detected in -deficient newborn piglets, which was in agreement with  PFF donor cells, but was not detected in wild-type piglets. Moreover, the  Exon 2 region containing a 27 bp region deleted as a result of homologous recombination was present in wild-type piglets (). On the other hand, -deficient piglets did not possess the deleted 27 bp region of  Exon 2. The genomic PCRs of -deficient piglets perfectly matched that of donor cells (#3-55,  PFF). These results imply that the piglets generated by SCNT were cloned from -deficient donor cells and possessed an inactivated  gene.
