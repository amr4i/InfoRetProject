DBS/DPS remain stable over extended time and temperature periods, often making this the only practical transport option in remote areas. However, the smaller sample volume reduces sensitivity and the cell-associated nucleic acid can reduce specificity , . For this reason, testing plasma samples is preferred, where feasible.
