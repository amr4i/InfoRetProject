The 2013 WHO HIV treatment guidelines strongly recommend routine viral load (VL) testing six and twelve months after treatment initiation and then at least every year thereafter (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) . VL testing enables clinicians to monitor the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy and to identify patients struggling with treatment adherence before they develop resistance. Identifying elevated VLs early and providing enhanced adherence support can lead to over 70% of patients successfully re-suppressing HIV viral replication to undetectable levels .
