To evaluate the MS identification quality, the theoretical and experimental ratios of molecular weight (M) and isoelectric point were determined. These obtained values are presented as radar axis labels (M ratio for radial value; isoelectric point ratio for annular value) in the radial chart in . In theory, if the identified proteins are the same ones from the same species, both the radial and annular values will be 1.0, and all the calculated spots will be located on the cyclical line 1.0 in radial chart. The more spots were observed near line 1.0, the higher quality the MS identifications obtained. We found that >95% of spots were located close to the cyclical line 1.0, indicating the good quality of MS identification for these proteins ().
