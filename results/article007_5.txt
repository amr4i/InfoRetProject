Female  and  reared from trap nests were observed during the autumn months of 2012 in a large flight cage (8.83.32.8 m) kept under greenhouse conditions in Dsseldorf, Germany. The bees could feed ad libitum from artificial flowers filled with sugar solution (3036%) which was exchanged daily. ,  and  were offered as pollen sources, as preliminary tests had shown their suitability as pollen sources for these bees. Additionally, hardwood nest boxes (5.510.03.3 cm) and stingless bee cerumen were provided for nest construction. Pollen manipulation outside of the nest boxes was documented on several occasions. When possible, samples of freshly deposited pollen loads were obtained for analysis of sugar concentration. Samples were weighed, diluted with demineralized water and mixed using a vortex (Reax Top, Heidolph, Germany) in order to solubilize the contained sugar. When all of the pollen was suspended in the water, the samples were centrifuged (Micro 20, Hettich, Switzerland, 13000 rpm for 10 minutes), and the sugar content of the supernatant was measured using a handheld refractometer (Krss Optronic, Germany). Resulting values were corrected for the dilution.
