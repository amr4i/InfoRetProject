The  Cpn20 and Cpn10(2) have been characterized structurally and functionally by our group and others in the past , , . The third co-chaperonin homolog - Cpn10(1) - has not yet been studied  or  and no obvious phenotype was found for a knockout strain . The active form of most known single-domained co-chaperonins (for example: GroES, mt-cpn10 and Cpn10(2)) is a heptamer. Thus, we wondered whether Cpn10(1) has a similar oligomeric state . In order to answer this question, we purified the recombinant Cpn10(1) and carried out cross-linking with DSS. As can be seen in , Cpn10(2) and GroES exhibit a cross-linking pattern that is typical for heptameric oligomers, as indicated by the time-dependent accumulation of seven bands of cross-linking products . Surprisingly, the cross-linking of Cpn10(1) yielded only two, low molecular-weight cross-linking products. These results suggest that Cpn10(1) retains a unique oligomeric state in solution and exists in dimeric form or as a mixture of dimers and monomers. An elution profile from the Superdex 75 gel filtration column supported these results, since the majority of the Cpn10(1) protein eluted in fractions 2023, in contrast to Cpn10(2), which eluted primarily in fractions 1618 ().
