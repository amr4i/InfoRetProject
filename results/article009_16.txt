To determine whether enhanced FGF signaling pathway activity may contribute to formation of supernumerary DC7 DA neurons, we treated  embryos with SU5402, an inhibitor of FGF signaling . SU5402 was applied to embryos for 6 hours from 42 to 48 hpf, the developmental period during which a significant amount of DC7 DA neurons becomes postmitotic . SU5402 treatment did not result in any significant changes in cell numbers of DC1-6 (compare ).  mutants had an average of 103.2 DC7 DA neurons, which is a 2-fold increase in DC7 cells in comparison to WT siblings (compare ' and B'; p = 0.008). SU5402 treated  mutant embryos developed an average of 56.2 DC7 neurons, while SU5402 treated WT siblings contained an average of 20.6 DC7 neurons (compare ' and F'; p = 0.008). Thus  mutants treated with SU5402 had only half the amount of DC7 neurons in comparison to non-treated  mutants (p = 0.008). However,  mutants treated with SU5402 still showed a 2.6 fold increase in cell number in comparison to SU5402 treated WT siblings (compare ' and F'; p = 0.008). The significant reduction of DA neurons in both  and WT embryos by SU5402 treatment by about 50% indicates that FGF signaling may be involved in formation of DC7 DA neurons. The increase in DA neuron number in  may in part be mediated by enhanced FGF signaling.
