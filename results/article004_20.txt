Drug interactions associated with the induction or inhibition of CYP enzymes was among the most important causes of side effects in humans, and the inhibition effect was considered as the most common mechanism involved in CYP-associated drug-drug interactions. The results of the present work indicated that MH had the potential to interact with a wide range of xenobiotics or endogenous chemicals that were CYP1A2 or CYP2C19 substrates during clinical treatment. Because these two enzymes are involved in the clearance of 67% of currently marketed drugs, there is a strong possibility that MH would be co-prescribed with drugs that interact and thus elicit frequent and severe adverse drug interactions in the population. However, it is important to note that the extent of drug interactions with MH might highly vary among individuals due to genetic polymorphisms of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In previous studies, allelic variants in the genes encoding CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 had been shown to affect enzyme activities. The alleles were classified as belonging to three major phenotypes: extensive metabolism, intermediate metabolism and poor metabolism. Thus, the effect of the gene polymorphisms of these two enzymes should be considered during clinical trials for MH in the future.
