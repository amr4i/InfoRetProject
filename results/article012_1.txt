Because of their anatomic, nutritional, physiologic, and genetic similarities to humans, pigs are essential for biomedical research , . The cloning of pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) was established in 2000 . Subsequently, SCNT combined with gene targeting has enabled the production of genetically modified pigs for use in xenotransplantation as human disease models and in regenerative medicine . Some genetically modified pig models show greater similarities to human diseases than rodent models. For example, pig models of cystic fibrosis, retinitis pigmentosa, Type 2 diabetes, X-linked SCID, and familial adenomatous polyposis models have been established . Regarding models of SCID, a T-B+NK- pig model of X-linked SCID was recently generated by targeted disruption of the  , . Moreover, the T-B-NK+ SCID model pigs that had  inactivated using gene editing technology have been recently reported in 2014 , . Although studies about SCID model pigs are beginning to be reported, there are only four reports to date. Therefore, additional research is necessary to establish pig SCID models. Our objective was to generate -deficient neonatal piglets of Duroc breed using SCNT with gene targeting, and analyze their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and histology.
