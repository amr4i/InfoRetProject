With the derived data, we developed a scoring system for prediction of SC, and different score values for variables were established according to their regression coefficients with the method described in  ().  shows the 1-year and 3-year SC probability associated with each score. For the above case, the scoring system gives an estimated SC probability of 25.18% in 1 year, and 75.35% in 3 years, indicating that there is good agreement between the estimates produced by the Cox model and the scoring system. We plotted the SC probability in 1 year and 3 years as calculated with the Cox model for each patient against the score (). As shown in , higher scores resulted in increased probability of SC. Excluding all censored data (ie, individuals who did not complete the 3 years of follow-up without having SC), the area under the ROC curve obtained with the scoring system was 0.831 (95% CI 0.8040.858, p<0.001), indicating that the scoring system could discriminate well between patients who had SC and those who did not. Finally, for comparison, all patients were divided into 3 groups based on SC probabilities against scores (): (1) patients with a score 0 (low probability); (2) patients with a score between 1 and 10 (intermediate probability); (3) patients with a score>10 (high probability). A survival curve was constructed for each group.  shows that the high-probability group had a lower probability of defect remaining open than the low-probability group (p<0.001, ). It was proven that increased scores were associated with significantly increased SC probabilities. The observed rates of SC (and the expected probability in 3 years) in these strata were 6.5% (<4%) for low probability, 22.6% (4.8253.35%) for intermediate probability, 75.9% (64.4292.37%) for high probability ().
