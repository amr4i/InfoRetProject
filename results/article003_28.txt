S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase catalyzes the joining of methionine and ATP to produce the ubiquitous methyl group donor SAM. Overexpression of  improves the development and secondary metabolism of the filamentous fungus  . In the budding yeast , low expression of  reduces the growth, mating, and sporulation, whereas  overexpression leads to the methionine sensitive-growth . Overaccumulation of SAM synthase in the bacterium  results in increased spontaneous sporulation . Low abundance of SAM synthase in  blocks filament formation in the septal ring . FBA, a class II family aldolase, is widely detected in organisms from fungi to prokaryotes, and the homodimer catalyzes the aldol cleavage of fructose bisphosphate using a zinc ion. In , mutation of the FBA gene perturbs growth but is not lethal for this fungus . In , FBA is the primary enzyme that counters of nickel toxicity . Among the potential virulence enzymes, phosphoglycerate kinase is widely considered as a key enzyme in the reversible transfer of a phosphate from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP, thereby resulting in the formation of 3-phosphoglycerate and ATP in glycolysis .
