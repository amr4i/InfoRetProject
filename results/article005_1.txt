Biological networks have been described using kinetic models for decades ; however, these require kinetic parameters and are computationally more complex. Steady state models based on stoichiometric and flux constraints provide a comparatively straightforward platform for analysis of complex systems where kinetic parameters are not required. Among such steady state modeling techniques, FBA is one of the most prevalent for modeling cellular metabolism. FBA has been applied to central metabolism-focused networks containing a few hundred reactions ,  as well as genome-scale reconstructions containing thousands of reactions, and has been demonstrated to successfully predict growth , , estimate theoretical yields from heterologous pathways , locate engineering targets to maximize product yield , and design antibiotics . While typical FBA is limited in that kinetics, thermodynamics, and gene-regulation are often neglected, FBA has remained in favor because it provides a straightforward platform for analysis of complex systems.
