expression in early zebrafish brain development has been analyzed in detail in comparison to  and  gene expression . At 3 dpf  is expressed in the telencephalon, posterior tuberculum, hypothalamus, thalamus, epiphysis, midbrain tegmentum, rostral hindbrain and retina. We performed in situ hybridization to analyze the development of  expressing neurons in  mutants at 3 dpf. The analysis revealed that  WISH stain intensity was increased in  mutant embryos in all cell clusters (; p = 0.004). To address whether the stronger signal may be caused by an increase in mRNA levels or the formation of additional CRH neurons, we counted  expressing cells in proximity to DA neurons in the posterior tuberculum and hypothalamus (boxes in ). In this region, we identified approximately twice the number of  neurons in  mutant embryos in comparison to wild-type siblings ( legend; ; p = 0.008).
