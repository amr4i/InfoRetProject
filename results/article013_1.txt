Oxidative stress and inflammation are crucial for defense against infections, but they can initiate a number of deleterious effects, such as impairment of intracellular calcium transport and production of cytokines. In chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) is thought to play an important role in disease progression ,. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a pro-inflammatory enzyme that is involved in the production of nitric oxide (NO). In chronic kidney disease, oxidative stress has been found to increase in parallel with diseases progression . The pro-inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is induced mainly at sites of inflammation in response to inflammatory stimuli including TNF-. Elevated Cox-2 expression has been found in approximately 50% of adenomas and 85% of adenocarcinomas .
