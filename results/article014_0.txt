Chaperonins are a family of ~1000 kDa cylindrical protein complexes, composed of two partners, the 60 kDa chaperonin (Cpn60) and the 10 kDa co-chaperonin (Cpn10). Together, these chaperones provide a compartment in which a substrate polypeptide is isolated from the cellular environment and can safely fold in an ATP - dependent manner . The prototypical system found in  provides the bulk of our knowledge on the oligomeric chaperonin complexes. For this system, high resolution structures of the GroEL tetradecamer (Cpn60) and its co-chaperonin, the GroES heptamer (Cpn10), have been solved by X-ray crystallography both individually and in a variety of complexes . Two seven-membered rings of GroEL form the main chaperonin structure in which the substrate protein finds protection. Seven subunits of GroES assemble into dome-like structures, which cap the ends of the GroEL cylinder and induce formation of the protein-folding chamber. The interaction between the two oligomers is mediated by a ~20 residue sequence of GroES, known as the mobile loop, an unstructured region that adopts a -hairpin conformation when bound to GroEL , , . At the other end of the GroES subunit is an additional loop, seven of which form a roof-like ceiling in the heptameric co-chaperonin oligomer.
