In summary, our studies provide evidence that the FOXO1 transcription factor may negatively regulate activin induction of  synthesis through FOXO1 binding to the proximal  promoter as well as through a direct interaction between the FOXO1 DBD and SMAD3/4. Since these experiments were performed in immortalized gonadotrope cells, additional studies are needed to determine whether FOXO1 functions in the pituitary to negatively regulate gonadotropin production . Moreover, since FOXO proteins act as coactivators of SMAD-dependent transcription in several other cell types , , , future studies are required to understand how FOXO1 acts as a repressor of activin signaling in pituitary gonadotrope cells. It may also be worthwhile to investigate whether FOXO1 regulates additional activin responsive genes in gonadotrope cells including the GnRH receptor and follistatin . Interactions between FOXO and SMAD proteins may also be important for regulation of gene expression in other reproductive tissues that express both of these transcription factors such as the ovary and uterus , .
