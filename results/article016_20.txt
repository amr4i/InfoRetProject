In the matrix and circle views, nodes are positioned along the sides of a square matrix, or on the circumference of a circle, respectively (see ). Matrix entries and arcs between circle nodes are used to represent connections. Circular ideograms similar to the circle view exist in the open source software packages MNE python  and Circos . Both the matrix and circle views are affected by the order in which the nodes are positioned.  shows different visualizations of the fMRI network from  with two different node orderings. The first ordering is an unprincipled organization in which nodes are ordered alphabetically by region name; the second shows nodes ordered by anatomy, beginning in the frontal lobe, wrapping around the parietal and occipital lobes, and ending at the temporal pole. The anatomically principled ordering shows the structure of the dataset  primarily comprised of connections with strong lateral connectivity  much more clearly.

Each of the three views  the 3D brain, connectivity matrix, and connectivity circle, is updated simultaneously whenever parameters of the visualization change. Any of the three views can be exported to high resolution images for figure generation. In addition, the 3D brain can also record movies which capture user-defined interactive camera movements and can also optionally include a simple animation to rotate the displayed brain.
