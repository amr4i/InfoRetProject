Images of WISH gene expression data were analyzed to determine whether significant differences in WISH signal intensities exist when wildtype control and mutant or experimental embryos were compared. To compare WISH signal intensities, control and experimental embryos were fixed and processed together. For mutant and WT embryos, both were processed together in one reaction tube, and genotypes determined by PCR after alkaline phosphatase stain reaction. Thus, WISH and stain procedures were under exactly identical conditions for samples to be compared. For each analysis, control and experimental WISH embryos were photographed in one session under identical imaging conditions (same orientation of embryo, comparable focal plane, same lens, DIC, and light setting on microscope, same exposure setting on ZEISS Axiocam MRc camera utilizing Axiovision software). For control and experimental embryos, typically five to six each were documented (see number of embryos N reported with experiments).
