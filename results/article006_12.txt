Surgery is considered the gold standard for the treatment of VSD, but it is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality . Zhuang et al. reported a postoperative mortality rate of 5.65%, mainly due to pulmonary hypertensive crisis and arrhythmia , and Demirag et al. noted 6.4% early postoperative deaths . Particularly, young children with low body weight were reported to be at high risk, with 14.29% and 14.71% mortality in patients aged less than 1 year and weighing less than 7 kg, respectively . We suggest that surgical PMVSD correction should be reserved for cases in which SC cannot be expected. Additionally, in China, due to non-advanced medical technology in underdeveloped areas with non-specialized cardiovascular physicians, the transfer and accommodation of patients and their attending families into distant specialized hospitals are particular obstacles. Our simple scoring system, which includes all the factors that are routinely used for the same decision-making process might help to predict spontaneous VSD closure and indicate necessary operations.
