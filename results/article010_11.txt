Ion concentrations of study cities were divided by corresponding average ion concentration of 4 background sites. Namely, concentration multiples of study cities to background sites were used to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient for each site (). The water-soluble ion concentrations in PM were similar in the 3 case study cities (correlation coefficient>0.8334, <0.05) and displayed relatively low similarity between 3 case study cities and Datong. This implied that the North China sites might have similar sources of PM. There was a significant correlation between Datong and Shijiazhuang, and between Beijing and Tianjin in PM (correlation coefficient>0.8047, <0.05). This implies that fugitive dust contributed a larger share of particles to Shijiazhuang. This is supported by the significantly higher Ca concentration in Shijiazhuang, which is derived primarily from soil sources.
