Of the 382 patients in the validation cohort, 34 patients (8.9%) had SC, which was much lower than in the derivation cohort (p<0.001). 244 patients underwent surgery for their defect and 104 patients had persisting VSD whose follow up period was much shorter than that in the derivation cohort (, ). The area under the ROC curve was 0.863 (95% CI 0.7850.941, p<0.001), indicating a good prediction of the scoring system. In the validation cohort, 187 (49%) of the patients were classified as low probability cases, 183 (47.9%) as intermediate probability cases, and 12 (3.1%) as high probability cases. Similar to the data shown in , increased scores were associated with significantly increased SC probabilities (p<0.001, ). The observed rates of SC (and the expected probability in 3 year) were 3.2% (<4%) for low probability, 10.9% (4.8253.35%) for intermediate probability, 83.3% (64.4292.37%) for high probability (). The observed rate of SC of the intermediate probability group in the validation cohort was much lower than that in the derivation cohort (10.9% vs. 22.6%, p<0.05), while other scores did not differ significantly between the 2 cohorts, indicating the reliability of the score grouping.
