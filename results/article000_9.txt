The proportion of viable and nonviable  in membrane filtrated, centrifuged, and untreated samples was investigated by fluorescence microscopy. For this, NaCl was spiked with 3.0101.510 CFU/ml  cells prior to recovery. Analysis of six fluorescence microscopy images from each of the three replicates revealed a significantly (<0.05) lower mean percentage of viable bacteria (green) in untreated samples (61.08%) compared to filtrated (79.55%) or centrifuged (76.95%) samples, whereas the percentages of nonviable cells (red) were 38.92%, 20.45%, and 23.05%, respectively, in untreated, filtrated, and centrifuged samples (). No intermediate (orange) cells could be detected, and the proportions of viable and nonviable cells did not differ significantly between filtrated and centrifuged samples ().
