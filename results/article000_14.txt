The relationship between qPCR or EMA-qPCR results, and culture-based enumeration was assessed after recovery of  cells from water samples. For this, tap water was spiked with 1.5102.310 CFU/ml of reference strain  DSM 4688, and the amounts of cells were calculated after recovery by membrane filtration. Even though qPCR-based quantification of  without EMA detected slightly higher (<0.05) amounts of cells (mean difference: 0.420.133 SD log CFU/ml) than the microbiological reference method (), the correlation coefficients of qPCR (R = 0.921; slope, 0.864) and EMA-qPCR (R = 0.863; slope, 0.939) versus culture enumeration were comparable. This finding was also reflected by Bland-Altman analysis. In the absence of EMA, the mean difference between the two methods was 0.0990.442 SD log CFU and the 95% limit of agreement was 0.766 to 0.965 CFU (log) (). Similarly, the Bland-Altman plot determined a high agreement between the results from EMA-qPCR and culture enumeration. The mean difference in log CFU was 0.189 (0.579 SD) with lower and upper limits of 0.946 and 1.323, respectively (). For the sake of completeness, 13 field isolates were subjected to comparable EMA-qPCR quantification as described above. For two isolates, results were achieved from EMA-qPCR, but culture-based enumeration failed to detect . Therefore, these strains were excluded from the Pearson correlation analysis. For the remaining strains, there was a linear relationship between the results from both methods (R = 0.936, slope 0.928) ().
