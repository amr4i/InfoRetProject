To further investigate how activin-induced  transcription is inhibited by FOXO1, we tested whether the FOXO1 DBD was necessary for the repression, as previously demonstrated for FOXO1 suppression of basal and GnRH-induced  and  gene expression , . As a control for the level of protein expression, we demonstrated that comparable levels of FOXO1-CA and a FOXO1-CA-DBD mutant were expressed when transfected into LT2 cells (). While FOXO1-CA overexpression in LT2 cells suppressed activin-induced -luc, overexpression of FOXO1-CA with a DBD mutation (FOXO1-CA-DBD, ) was not able to repress activin induction of  (). These results indicate that the FOXO1 DBD is necessary to elicit an inhibitory effect on activin signaling to the  promoter.
