The accumulation patterns of proteins and their transcripts were similar for all the selected proteins except for amidase (; ). After culturing for 2 or 4 days, most of the selected genes showed higher expression in F4 than in F1. At day 6, both proteins and mRNA levels were reduced to some extent (). Taken together, functional analysis of the F4-specific proteins revealed that some enzymes, including catalase-peroxidase, galactosidase, glucanosyltransferase, phosphoglycerate kinase, mitochondrial ATP synthase, glutathione reductase, adenosine kinase, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, enolase, and chitinase, are involved in a variety of metabolic pathways and biological processes in F4.
