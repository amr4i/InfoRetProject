In recent years, there has been growing interest in using MCPs as nanobioreactors by encapsulating enzymes for engineered synthetic pathways , . To this end, methods are established for encapsulating heterologous enzymes within MCPs. For instance, in the Pdu system, two of the natively encapsulated enzymes, PduP and PduD, bear N-terminal signal peptides which are sufficient to mediate the encapsulation of heterologous proteins , . However, it is also necessary to understand and gain control of the regulatory mechanism that drives MCP formation, potentially enabling the tuning of the timing, copy number, and size of MCPs.

For the Pdu MCP system, previous studies identified the DNA-binding protein PocR to be a -acting positive regulator of both the  operon and the adjacent, divergently-transcribed  operon in  , , . The regulation of these two operons involves five promoters in the  locus . The substrate 1,2-PD is implicated in an allosteric interaction with PocR leading to activation of the P promoter . This allosteric interaction is thought to similarly regulate the P promoter in response to 1,2-PD, in combination with the global Crp and Arc regulatory systems which also affect the level of  expression . These studies preceded the discovery of the Pdu MCP, and to date the implications of these regulatory mechanisms on MCP expression and formation have not been explored.
