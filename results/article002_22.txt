Next, we show that the transcription factor PocR is a necessary component of MCP regulation, and heterologous expression of PocR in the absence of 1,2-PD results in the formation of MCPs morphologically similar to those formed upon induction by 1,2-PD. We further find that Pdu MCPs expressed in the absence of chromosomal  are functional for 1,2-PD metabolism , suggesting that these MCPs are encapsulating the appropriate Pdu metabolic enzymes in addition to forming morphologically normal MCPs. In fact, PocR overexpression led to faster growth even in a  strain with intact chromosomal . This could be due to earlier Pdu MCP formation, as a result of apparently earlier transcriptional activation as observed using the transcriptional fusion, or another factor such as different enzyme loading to the MCPs or different numbers of MCPs per cell with respect to the wild type.
