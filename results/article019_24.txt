is the fluorescence after the addition of agonist in the absence of the compound,

is the fluorescence before the addition of agonist in the absence of the compound.

The  factor was calculated using the following equation:

Where:

is the mean of the maximum fluorescence in the presence of agonist,

is the mean of the maximum fluorescence in the presence of agonist and antagonist.

The geometries of compounds ,  and  were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level and the corresponding frequencies (all 0) proved that they are minima. These geometries were reoptimized at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level. Absolute shieldings (, ppm) and SSCC (Hz) were calculated on these geometries using the GIAO approximation for the  values. The corresponding chemical shifts (, ppm) were obtained using the empirical transformation equations we have established for a large collection of compounds. The used equations transform calculated values in the gas phase to experimental values in solution (usually CDCl or DMSO-). See supplementary data.
