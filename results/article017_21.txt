To further examine the mechanism of FOXO1 repression of activin induction, we tested whether FOXO1 could alter SMAD-dependent transcription in gonadotrope cells. Initially, we examined the effect of FOXO1-CA overexpression on SMAD induction of  gene expression. Overexpression of SMAD3 or SMAD4 induced  transcription by 34 fold while overexpression of SMAD3 and SMAD4 resulted in a 28-fold induction (). Noticeably, FOXO1-CA overexpression resulted in a profound inhibition of SMAD3/4 induction of  synthesis (). We also demonstrated that the FOXO1 DBD was required for the suppression of SMAD3/4-induced  transcription (). Since FOXO1 suppression of activin-induced  transcription mapped to the 304/95 region of the  promoter that contains multiple SMADs and FOXL2 binding sites, we tested whether activin induction of a multimer containing four repeats of a consensus binding element for SMADs or FOXL2 (SBE or FLRE) was inhibited by FOXO1. Activin induced the 4SBE-luc by 4 fold while the 4FLRE-luc was induced by 1.5 fold (). Interestingly, overexpression of FOXO1-CA significantly reduced the fold activin induction of the SBE but had no effect on the FLRE (). Additionally, overexpression of FOXO1-CA with a DBD mutation was unable to suppress activin induction of the SBE, indicating that the FOXO1 DBD was also required for this effect. The weak activin induction of the 4FLRE and the lack of activin induction of a multimer of the 350/341 FOXL2 binding site  suggest that, unlike an SBE, a FOXL2 binding site is not sufficient for activin induction and thus, it is difficult to assess the role of FOXL2 in the FOXO1 suppression. In contrast, our data provides strong evidence that overexpression of FOXO1-CA results in decreased activin and SMAD-induction of  in immortalized gonadotrope cells.
