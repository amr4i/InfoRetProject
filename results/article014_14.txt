The fact that purified Cpn10(1) is not active in assisting protein folding raises the question as to why plants harbor a non-functional species? The answer to this question may be provided by a recent study showing that  harbors three co-chaperonin forms, which are functional only upon incorporation into mixed hetero-oligomeric co-chaperonin species. The authors demonstrated that the  Cpn10(2) is also capable of forming functional mixed hetero-oligomers with the  Cpn20  . Since both co-chaperonins, Cpn20 and Cpn10(2), were active individually as homo-oligomers , , , the functional significance of the formed hetero-oligomers remained obscure.
