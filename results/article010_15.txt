Secondary ions play a key role in the formation of particulate matter . The non-organic secondary ions NH, SO and NO accumulate under stable weather conditions. Secondary ions also affect atmospheric visibility and human health . The total mass of secondary ions contributed 42.4% and 31.5% of the PM and PM, respectively. The major water-soluble ions were the secondary inorganic ions sulfate, nitrate and ammonium, which accounted for 77% of the total water-soluble ions in Beijing in 2008 . The ratio of [NO]/[SO] in aerosols can be used to analyze the contribution of mobile sources (such as vehicle exhaust) to stationary sources (such as boilers) . Coal is the main source of SO emissions. NO originates from motor vehicles and coal burning , . An increased NO contribution to PM mass loading during polluted periods has been reported .  shows the [NO]/[SO] ratios of the different sites and seasons. The ratios during summer were smaller than those in the other three seasons because the high temperatures transform particulate nitrate into the gaseous state, thus reducing the [NO]/[SO] ratio . In winter, the [NO] <[SO] in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang implies a dominance of sulfate pollution from heating and industrial coal burning. In contrast, in Beijing, [NO]> [SO] and the concentration of NO continued to increase in Beijing in 2011 , which indicates that vehicles made a greater contribution to emissions than in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang.
