To determine whether FOXO1-CA suppression of activin-induced transcription also occurs on the endogenous  promoter in gonadotropes, we transfected LT2 cells with a control GFP adenovirus (Ad-GFP) or an adenovirus containing FOXO1-CA (Ad-FOXO1-CA) and measured  mRNA levels relative to  in response to vehicle, activin, GnRH, or activin and GnRH co-treatment. As previously reported , overexpression of FOXO1-CA significantly decreased basal  mRNA levels by 62% (). In LT2 cells transduced with Ad-GFP,  mRNA levels were induced 17 fold by activin and 4 fold by GnRH while cotreatment with activin and GnRH resulted in a synergistic 60 fold induction, similar to what was previously reported , . In contrast, activin induction was decreased by 62%, GnRH by 65% and activin and GnRH synergy by 82% in cells transduced with Ad-FOXO1-CA (). These results indicate that constitutively active FOXO1 suppression of activin-, GnRH- or activin and GnRH-induced  gene expression occurs in the context of the native chromatin.
