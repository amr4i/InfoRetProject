RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 48-well culture plates (110 cells/well) and cultured overnight. The cells were then cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and LPS (100 ng/mL) with 500 M gentiopicroside, swertiamarin or gentiolactone for 8 hours. TNF- protein levels in the culture media were measured using a Quantikine ELISA mouse TNF- Immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

To prepare whole-cell lysates, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% NP-40, 150 mM, NaCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor cocktail). After homogenization, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000 for 10 min. The supernatants were deemed whole lysates. To obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, we used an NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo, Rockford, IL, USA). Total protein contents were quantified using Coomassie Plus (Thermo). Proteins in the extracts (50 g) were separated by 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to Amersham Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) with NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked with 2% ELC advance blocking reagent (GE Healthcare) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with specific primary antibodies; the membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by Lumigen TMA-6 (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare).
