The consumption of contaminated poultry meat is not the only source of human campylobacteriosis outbreaks.  spp. also occur in aquatic environments; thus, thousands of people have been exposed to contaminated drinking water in recent years , , . As a consequence, reports have been published on waterborne  outbreaks and gastroenteritis infections , . However, these cases may still be underestimated due to a lack of testing and notification systems in many countries . As it is difficult to isolate  cells from water, which was confirmed by results from two field isolates in our study, PCR-based methods have been applied for the quantitative detection of genome copies , , . In contrast, little is known about the applicability of a viability qPCR approach to quantify  from water samples. Previous studies used pretreatment with intercalating dyes in initial experiments to investigate the survival of cells in freshwater  and to inhibit PCR signals from heat-killed  in river water , .
