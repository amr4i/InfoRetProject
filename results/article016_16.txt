Determining the best visualization for a complex network may be difficult due to the high dimensionality of the data. In graph theory, the two most common types of visualizations are , which display links between nodes as lines of arbitrary orientations, and , in which nodes comprise the rows and columns while the matrix entries correspond to links. The best visualization depends on the structure of the dataset and the desired task  it has been argued that node link diagrams are more intuitive for graphs with few nodes, but are inferior to matrix representations when the number of nodes is large .
