A run is defined as a sequence of like items that is preceded and followed by one or more items of another type or by none at all. Items can be plus and minus signs, heads and tails, odd and even numbers, and numbers above and below a certain value, for example the median. Runs analysis are useful for such different purposes as digital image analysis, looking for extra-terrestrial intelligence, testing for roulette fraud and serial correlation among residuals in a regression analysis  and for detection of shifts in health care processes. Runs analysis makes no assumptions on the theoretical distribution of data.
