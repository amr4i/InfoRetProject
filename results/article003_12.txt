To compare the growth patterns of races F1 and F4, 2-day liquid cultures were examined by light microscopy. Both mycelia and spores from F1 () and F4 () demonstrated similar morphology, which is consistent with our previous report that F1 and F4 had similar morphology when grown on potato dextrose agar medium . In a KK liquid medium, F1 and F4 showed similar growth curves () and similar changes in dry weight content from day 28 (). The mycelium concentration increased sharply after being cultured for 2 days, peaked at 4 days, and decreased at 6 days. After culturing for more than 6 days, the mycelium concentration as well as the dry weight content plateaued to some extent ().
