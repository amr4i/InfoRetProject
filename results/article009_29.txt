Following WISH, tail clips for DNA extraction were performed and the tightly linked BX294656.8 3p, CR855270.17 and p9 BX927237 p4 SSLP markers were used for genotyping comparing  mutant and wild-type embryos respectively.

digoxigenin-labeled sense probe was generated by linearizing the pCRIITOPO- plasmid with BamHI.  digoxigenin-labeled antisense probe was generated linearizing the pCRIITOPO- plasmid with EcoRV. In addition, the following digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes were used:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , , and  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  .

Both methods were performed as previously described .

Morpholinos were obtained from Gene Tools LLC. Knock down of maternal and zygotic Cnot8  achieved by coinjection of  () and  Morpholino at 1 cell stage in wild-type embryos.  Morpholino was previously described .
