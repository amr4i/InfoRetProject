In this research, we found 37 proteins containing predicted signal peptides such as catalase-peroxidase 2, superoxide dismutase, l-amino acid oxidase, carboxy-muconate cyclase and galactosidase. Therefore, we inferred that, during the infection process, proteins with signal peptides in  might be secreted into the plant extracellular space, which eventually causes the banana plant wilt. We also obtained some proteins that are involved in virulence, antagonism other fungi, and defense, including serine carboxypeptidase, superoxide dismutase, disulphide isomerase, and lactonohydrolase. Some of these proteins were predicted and/or reported to function as virulence factors ( and ), such as peptidase C1 , carboxypeptidase , , glucanosyltransferase , , S-adenosylmethionine synthetase , peroxiredoxin , chitinase 1 , catalase-peroxidase , and amidase . These results indicated that signal peptidescontaining proteins and virulence factors might be important contributors to the strong virulence seen in Fusarium-induced banana wilt.
