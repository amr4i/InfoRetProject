There is considerable evidence that gonadotropin production may be modulated by metabolic hormones such as insulin, in addition to reproductive hormones . One group of candidate genes that may be regulated by insulin in gonadotropes is the FOXO subfamily of forkhead box transcription factors. FOXOs have been shown to be key regulators of cellular pathways involved in apoptosis, stress resistance, cell cycle arrest, and DNA damage repair , . They also have important roles in metabolism, homeostasis and reproduction.  knockout mice have an age-dependent reduction in fertility caused by defective ovarian follicular growth, similar to premature ovarian failure in women . Conditional knockouts of  have demonstrated that FOXO1 plays a role in ovarian granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis, along with FOXO3 and that FOXO1 is essential for maintenance and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells in the testis , . The activity of FOXOs is regulated by post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination . Activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, in response to insulin/growth factor stimulation, results in FOXO phosphorylation, nuclear export and inhibition of their transcriptional activities .
