Interestingly, a clear synergistic effect can be seen in  upon titrating Cpn20 in the presence of a constant concentration of Cpn10(1). At low concentrations of Cpn20 (for example 0.25 ratio of [co-chaperonin]/[GroEL]), where the refolding yield is sub-saturating for Cpn20 alone, the presence of Cpn10(1) resulted in a 5-fold increase in refolding activity (15.71% and 78.26% respectively - ). A similar effect was seen using Cpn60 (). In this case, the increase in refolding was from 51.39% to 77.83%. These results suggest that Cpn20 and Cpn10(1) combined to form functional hetero-oligomeric species.
