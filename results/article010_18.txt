The PM regression slopes were <1 in Beijing and Tianjin, but slightly>1 in Shijiazhuang. The PM regression slopes of [NH] against ([SO]+[NO]) at the three cities were <1, indicating that SO and NO in large particles were incompletely neutralized. Larger slope coefficients and higher NH concentrations were found in Shijiazhuang. One possible reason for this was the greater agricultural fertilizer usage (489.0 million tons in Shijiazhuang, compared to 136.7 million tons in Beijing and 244.5 million tons in Tianjin in 2012. Data from 2013 were not available at the time of our study), which was one of the primary sources of NH. Since evaporated ammonium was not taken into account, the extent of SO and NO neutralization might have been underestimated.
