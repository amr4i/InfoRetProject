In contrast, investigation of spiked tap water samples revealed a general agreement between the methods.  CFU calculated from qPCR and EMA-qPCR signals were approximately equivalent to those from microbiological cell counts, as shown by Pearson correlation analysis and a Bland-Altmann plot. For analysis of samples containing viable cells, it appears that both PCR techniques can be used interchangeably, whereas an advantage of EMA-qPCR could be demonstrated after analysing defined live/dead mixtures of  cells up to a 1:100 dilution. Hence, these results are in good accordance with reports on  and  , , in which qPCR techniques were successfully used with intercalating dyes to distinguish live from membrane-compromised cells after filter-based recovery of cells from water samples.
