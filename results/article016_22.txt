An example of network statistics calculated for multi-modal networks is shown in , using the same networks from . Networks for a single subject were constructed from resting state fMRI, high b-value Q-space diffusion imaging, and resting state MEG. The weighted degree of each node is displayed as the size and color of the sphere in the node, although it is also possible to use the size and color to represent two unrelated variables. Networks constructed from these different modalities show highly different topology: the most important nodes in the diffusion network are clustered around the white matter tracts in cingulate cortex, while in the resting state fMRI and MEG networks the strongest nodes are distributed widely throughout different areas of the neocortex.
