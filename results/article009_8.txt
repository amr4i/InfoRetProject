Based on the maternal and zygotic expression,  mutant embryos are expected to contain about half the amount of wild-type functional maternal protein, but no functional zygotic mRNA derived Cnot8 protein. Therefore, the mutant phenotype represents the gradual loss of functional maternally derived protein during embryonic stages, as most maternal mRNAs appear to be degraded during blastula and gastrulation stages . Stable maternal derived Cnot8 protein may therefore persist well through the first two to three days of development. Therefore, we investigated whether translational block of  mRNA by antisense Morpholino oligonucleotides directed against sequence including the start Cnot8 ATG () would cause a phenotype stronger than . Injection of a low amount of  (1 ng) lead to a more severe morphological phenotype, while 28 ng amounts caused early lethality (). The morphant phenotype was not further investigated because Morpholino-induced broadly lethal phenotypes are difficult to analyze. We also did not attempt to generate maternal and zygotic mutant embryos based on mutant germline clones, because we reasoned that Cnot deficient germline might be cell-lethal. We also investigated whether microinjection of mRNA encoding the wild-type Cnot8 protein into one-cell stage embryos would rescue the  mutant phenotype, but did not achieve a significant rescue (data not shown). We interpret this as injected mRNA similar to maternal mRNA being degraded during early development, and not being able to contribute to a rescue of the phenotype on the third day of development and later.
