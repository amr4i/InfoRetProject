While an allosteric interaction between PocR and 1,2-PD is thought to be required for P activation at native expression levels of PocR, high levels of PocR by heterologous overexpression appear to be sufficient to overcome the requirement of 1,2-PD for PocR binding, and still result in normal MCP formation. Supporting this theory, we observe higher levels of fluorescence from the PGFP reporter when both PocR is overexpressed and 1,2-PD is present compared to PocR overexpression alone, consistent with an allosteric interaction increasing the affinity of PocR for its target sequence.
