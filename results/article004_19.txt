Our study showed that CYP1A2 was most sensitive to the inhibition by MH ( = 4.47 M), and CYP2C19 was less sensitive to the inhibition by MH ( = 10.91 M). CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 were hardly sensitive to the inhibition of MH ( were all more than 100 M) (). The  value of CYP1A2 for the O-deethylation of phenacetin was 3.2-fold higher than that of FUR in the HLMs. The effect of MH on the O-deethylation of phenacetin metabolism was further assayed using CYP1A2 (10 pmol), by the co-incubation of phenacetin (final concentration of 3, 10, 30 or 100 M) with MH (final concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 50 and 100 M) for 30 min. The  values were evaluated using the Dixon plot method (). The results showed that MH, at concentrations lower than 100 M, significantly inhibited the CYP1A2-catalysed O-deethylation of phenacetin with  = 4.56 M, which was approximately 1.5-fold higher than that of FUR in the HLMs. The type of competition appears to be competitive inhibition. . Showed the Dixon plots for the inhibition of CYP2C19 by MH in the HLMs. The  value of CYP2C19 for 4-hydroxyl of S-Mephenytoin was 6.821.8-fold higher than that of TCL in the HLMs. MH was a moderate inhibitor for CYP2C19, with an estimated  value of 42.65 M (). According to Kong  , the potency of a test compound could be classified according to its  values, as potent, if 20 g/mL or 10 M; moderate, if  20100 g/mL or 1050 M; or weak, if 100 g/mL or 50 M. Thus, MH is a potent inhibitor for CYP1A2, a moderate inhibitor for CYP2C19 and a weak inhibitor for the other five CYPs tested in this study.
