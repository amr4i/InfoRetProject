The human IL-1 DuoSet ELISA kit was purchased from R&D Systems, Biomedica, Vienna, Austria. All other ELISA kits were purchased from Peprotech, Vienna, Austria. The assays were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. Briefly, NUNC MaxiSorp flat-bottom 96-well plates (eBioscience, Affymetrix, Vienna, Austria) were coated with a capture antibody overnight and blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. After washing, cell supernatants were added and incubated for at least 2 h at room temperature (RT). Plates were washed again and the biotinylated detection antibody was added. After incubation for 1 h at RT, plates were again washed and avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was added. After 30 min of incubation and another washing step, the substrate (TMB from Sigma-Aldrich) was added. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 M sulphuric acid. Colour intensity was measured at 450 nm and a reference wavelength of 650 nm was subtracted. The respective standards were used to calculate total protein concentrations.
