Our previous study identified a series of ()-2-(2-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)vinyl)quinolinederivatives that showed cytotoxic effects on both PC3 and LNCaP cells . Among the compounds from this series, CFS-1686 demonstrated the highest potency against PC3 cell proliferation (). To decipher the mechanism by which this compound affects cells, we first compared the effect of CFS-1686 with CPT on cell cycle progression. By using a BrdU incorporation assay to measure the efficiency of DNA replication, we observed that CFS-1686 and CPT reduced DNA synthesis by about 70% and 80%, respectively, in comparison with control cells treated with DMSO (). Furthermore, cytometric analysis showed that cells treated by CPT remained at the G1-S boundary, whereas the cells treated by CFS-1686 entered into the stage between G1 and G2, mainly at intra S-phase ().
