The shift test is based on the theory of long runs. Schilling showed that the expected length of the longest run in a sequence depends on the total number of elements in the sequence and is predictable within limits . The expected length of the longest run either above or below the median is , where n is the total number of data points not on the median (useful observations). Approximately 95% of the longest runs are predicted to be within +/ 3 of the expected value. For the purpose of detecting a change in process position, a shift, we are interested in the upper prediction limit. The upper prediction limit for longest run is  rounded to the nearest integer. For example, if one has a run chart of 20 data points, the expected longest run would be 4, and a run of  than 7 data points would indicate a shift in process level.
