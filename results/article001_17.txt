Adapting sample transport regulations to match the demonstrated HIV RNA stabilities would enable VL sample collection to expand and reach more people living with HIV. A one-week sample transport window would allow for bi-weekly or weekly sample collection, provided samples were kept at 25C, as might be possible with passive cooling devices, such as a cooler box.
