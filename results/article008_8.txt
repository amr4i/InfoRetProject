Another widely used test for non-random variation in run charts is the . A shift is an unusually long run of consecutive data points either above or below the median. Data points that fall on the median are not counted, that is they do not contribute to the run, nor do they break it. The cut-off value to define unusually long varies in the literature. Perla defines a shift as six or more consecutive data points on the same side on the median , while Carey and others recommend seven or eight data points depending on the purpose of the run chart and the total number of data points available .
