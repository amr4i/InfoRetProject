Targeting vector construction was performed as previously described . The porcine  gene targeting vector was designed using  Exon 2 (Accession Number: AB091392, GenBank: AB091392.1) in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. The 3 short homologous arm for the  KO vector was generated from a 1.5 kilo base pair (kb) fragment by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the forward primer  and the reverse primer  and the pig genomic DNA of Duroc fetal fibroblasts. Likewise, the 5 long homologous arm was generated from a 6.5 kb  gene fragment containing Exons 1 and 2 by PCR using the forward primer  and the reverse primer . The  heterozygous KO vector was constructed by the insertion of two homologous arms into the PGK-Neo/MC1-TK plasmid vector as previously described. The  homozygous KO PGK-Neo vector was modified to contain the antibiotic resistance gene CAG-blasticidin resistance gene (bsr).
