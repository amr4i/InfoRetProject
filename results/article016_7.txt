In this manuscript, we describe the features, usage, implementation and software dependencies of CVU. We illustrate the power of CVU's visualizations with example networks constructed from data from the Human Connectome Project. In the following section, we will briefly review the practice and findings of network analysis of human brain networks. As CVU is a visualization tool that requires a fully formed network as input, we will describe some schemes for creating brain networks and provide a limited review of other software packages that perform the network construction and can be used alongside CVU. Finally, we will review the advantages and limitations of CVU, and describe possible future directions for research.
