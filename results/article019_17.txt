To a solution of isomers  and  (0.50 g, 3 mmol) in water (8 mL) was added acetic anhydride (0.4 mL, 3.5 mmol) at 0C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1h at 0C and then for 2h at room temperature. The mixture was extracted with CHCl (10 mL). The organic layers were dried over MgSO and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude was successively washed with ether yielding a mixture of isomers 6a and 6b as a white powder (0.482 g, 77%). M.p. 184C. LC-MS: LC-MS retention time isomer  7.34 min [M+H]  = 210; isomer Z 7.83 min [M+H]  = 210. Elemental analysis calculated for CHNO: C, 68.87; H, 9.15; N, 6.69; found: C, 68.70; H, 9.35; N, 6.39.
