CVU can be scripted interactively, either by entering valid python code into the interactive shell, or by providing standalone scripts written in valid python. Standalone scripts are run by providing the script as an argument to CVU's launcher script. In addition, standalone scripts can be called interactively from the shell. These scripting features operate on the internal data structures directly, with several scripting helper functions additionally available for common operations, (e.g. loading a new adjacency matrix). Instructions on how to perform many useful operations in scripting mode are included in the documentation.
