We then explored the possibility that FOXO1 repression of activin signaling in gonadotropes is due to protein-protein interactions between FOXO1 and SMAD3/4. Our GST pulldown experiments confirmed that FOXO1 can directly interact with SMAD3 and SMAD4  and that this interaction was dependent on the FOXO1 DBD (). Notably, this was in contrast to the lack of interaction observed between FOXO1 and SMAD2. Since SMAD2 and SMAD3 are very similar proteins except that SMAD2 contains an insertion in the MH1 domain that prevents DNA binding, our data suggests that the inhibitory domain prevents interaction between FOXO1 and SMAD2. This idea is supported by the fact that the SMAD2 splice variant that lacks this insertion was reported to bind FOXO proteins . It is also noteworthy that SMAD3 and SMAD4 were previously reported to bind FOXO1 through the MH1 domain . FOXO1 interaction with SMAD3 and SMAD4 in an activin-dependent manner in co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggests that SMAD phosphorylation is required to bind FOXO1 (). This data is in agreement with the report that the FOXO1 interaction with SMAD3/4 was dependent on TGF treatment of the cells . Our studies also demonstrated that FOXO1 repressed the effects of SMAD3/4 overexpression on -luc and activin induction of a 4SBE-luc in a FOXO1 DBD-dependent manner (). Altogether, these results provide strong support for the hypothesis that FOXO1-CA modulates activin responsiveness of the  promoter by interacting with SMAD3/4 via the FOXO1 DBD.
