The bacterial strain used in this study is  serovar Typhimurium LT2. Cultures were grown in 2 mL of LB (lysogeny broth) Miller medium overnight supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic to maintain the plasmid (34 g/mL chloramphenicol, 50 g/mL carbenicillin, or 50 g/mL kanamycin). For growth in rich media, cultures were diluted 1:100 into lysogeny broth (LB) Miller supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. For growth in minimal media, cultures were diluted 1:1000 into no-carbon-E (NCE) minimal medium , supplemented with 1 mM MgSO4, 50 M ferric citrate, half the usual amount of appropriate antibiotic (17 g/mL chloramphenicol, 25 g/mL carbenicillin, or 25 g/mL kanamycin), and 42 mM succinate to support growth in the absence of coenzyme B12 for 1,2-PD metabolism. In cases where MCP formation under natural induction was desired, cultures were supplemented with 55 mM 1,2-PD. For growth on 1,2-PD, overnight cultures in LB Miller were resuspended to OD = 0.05 in NCE supplemented with 1 mM MgSO4, 50 M ferric citrate, 55 mM 1,2-PD, and 150 nM coenzyme B12 (adenosylcobalamin) as described previously . OD was measured subsequently as indicated. Culture volumes were 400 mL of media in 2 L flasks for MCP purification, 10 mL of media in 25 mm by 150 mm culture tubes for growth on 1,2-PD, and 5 mL of media in 24-well blocks (Analytical Sales and Services, Inc., cat. no. 24108) for transcriptional activation experiments.
