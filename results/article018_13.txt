For flow cytometry, 110 cells were suspended in 50 l of ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 3% i.a. FBS) including appropriate amounts of fluorescent-labelled antibodies. As a control for nonspecific binding, one aliquot of cells was labelled with isotype-specific control antibodies in excess concentration. Cells were analysed using a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Primary monocytes, moDCs and CD1c DCs were gated according to cell-specific surface markers (CD14, CD1a and CD1c, respectively). For analysis of CD40, CD80, CD83 and CD86 surface expression, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 110 cells was recorded for every sample. The fold-changes of the MFIs were then calculated compared to the control cells (PBS/BSA-induced cells) of each cell type, to allow direct comparison of the different cell types measured with different voltages and/or compensation settings. For analysis of TLR4 and CD14 surface expression, cells were gated according to the individual isotype controls, and the percentages of TLR4 and CD14 positive cells were used as readout. For statistical analysis, an ANOVA with a Dunnett post-test was performed for each cell type individually, using the MFI values (not the fold-change values), or the percentages of positive cells. Anti-human CD1c-FITC and mouse IgG1-PE isotype control were obtained from BioLegend, Vienna, Austria. Anti-human CD1a-FITC, CD14-FITC, CD14-PE, CD19-PE, mouse IgG1-FITC, mouse IgG2a-APC and mouse IgG2b-PE isotype controls were purchased from Immunotools, Vienna, Austria. Anti-human CD14-APC, CD1a-APC, mouse IgG1-FITC isotype control, CD40-APC, CD80-PE, CD83-APC and CD86-PE were acquired from BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium. Anti-human CD1c-APC and mouse IgG1-APC isotype control were purchased from R&D Systems, and anti-human TLR4 (CD284)-Alexa Fluor 488 was obtained from eBioscience.
