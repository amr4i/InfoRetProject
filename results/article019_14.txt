All chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. TLC: precoated silica-gel 60 254 plates (Merck), detection by UV light (254 nm). Flash-column Chromatography (FC): Kieselgel 60 (230400 mesh; Merck). Melting points (mp) were determined in open capillaries with a Gallenkamp capillary melting-points apparatus. H and C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Advance 300 spectrometer operating at 300.13 MHz and 75.47 MHz respectively, in CDCl or DMSO- as solvents. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm on the  scale. In the case of multiplets, the signals are reported as intervals. Signals were abbreviated as s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; and m, multiplet. Coupling constants are expressed in hertz. Hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a Shaker type hydrogenation apparatus (Parr). Elemental analysis was determined with a LECO Elemental Analyzer CHNS-932. LC-MS analyses were performed using an Alliance 2695 (Waters) with a diode array UV/Vis detector Waters 2996 and interfaced to a Micromass ZQ mass spectrometer. Analyses were performed using reversed phase HPLC silica based columns: column Bridge C18 3.5 mm (2.1100 mm). Using an injection volume of 3 mL, a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min and gradient elution (2 to 30% over 15 min) of acetonitrile in water. Acetonitrile contains 0.08% v/v formic acid and water contains 0.1% v/v formic acid. Analyses were monitored at 254 nm wavelength.

To a solution of 3-amino-1-adamantol (0.61 g, 3.7 mmol) in water (7 mL) was added acetic anhydride (0.45 mL) at 0C. The reaction mixture was kept at 0C in an ice bath for 1 hour. Then it was taken to room temperature and stirred for 2 hours. When the reaction was completed, the mixture was extracted with CHCl. The organic layers were dried over MgSO and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure yielding a white solid (0.343 g, 45%). M.p. 224.4C. Elemental analysis calculated for CHNO; C, 68.87; H, 9.15; N, 6.69; found: C, 68.59; H, 9.27; N, 6.86. RMN H (300 MHz, CDCl)  5.255.17 (s, 1H), 2.292.22 (m, 2H), 2.031.95 (m, 2H), 1.951.88 (m, 7H), 1.721.67 (m, 4H), 1.581.53 (m, 2H). C (75 MHz, CDCl)  169.8 (C = O), 69.6 (C-OH), 54.7 (C-NH), 49.5 (CH), 44.5 (2CH), 40.7 (2CH), 35.3 (CH), 31.0 (2CH), 25.0 (CH).
