Aerobic conditions are considered for all studies by setting a maximum glucose uptake of 10.5 mmol per gram dry cell weight per hour (mmol/gdcw/hr) and a maximum oxygen uptake of 15 mmol/gdcw/hr  (). The lower bound on the ATP maintenance reaction is held at a constant value of 3.15 mmol/gdcw/hr . Exponential growth is simulated by enforcing a minimum bound on the biomass reaction , . The required growth rate for this study is 0.3 hr, defined according to experimental observations for  MG1655 in minimal media (). Results for other minimum growth rates are summarized in . Ethylene yield is defined as the absolute value of the ratio of flux through the ethylene demand reaction and the glucose uptake reaction (mol ethylene/mol glucose). Ethylene production rate is defined as the flux value through the ethylene demand reaction (mmol/gdcw/hr).
