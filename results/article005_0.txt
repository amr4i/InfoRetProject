Developing better predictive models of metabolic network behavior is essential for exploiting microbial cell factories for biochemical production. Though microbial cell factories have been successfully engineered for the overproduction of a number of products including ethanol , , isobutanol , , alkanes , , and thermoplastics , , continued advancement in strain engineering requires increased understanding of the impacts of combinatorial mutations on overall physiology . Recent high-throughput genome engineering strategies such as trackable recursive multiplex recombineering (TRMR)  and multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE)  have allowed for rapid genome-wide search and combinatorial manipulation of microbial chromosomes . Computational design tools that allow for exploration of the combinatorial mutation space are thus valuable tools to guide such genome-wide experimental techniques, providing an avenue for analyzing the system-wide effects of genetic manipulations.
