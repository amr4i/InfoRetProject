Traditionally, the performance of Shewhart control charts is characterized by the average run length (ARL) to signal. ARL is the average number of data points it takes to pick up a change in process level. For practical and didactical reasons we chose to plot signal rates as a function of run chart length as our metric. First, it turned out to be impractical to identify ARL for our run chart rules when no signals were present. Because the prediction limits are dynamically adapted to the number of data points these simulations often entered endless loops creating extremely long data sequences making the simulation programme run for several days without completion. Second, the graphical presentation of signal rates are, in our experience, more intuitively understandable for clinicians without specific statistical training than are ARL's.
