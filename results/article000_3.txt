The type strain  DSM 4688 (Leibniz-Institut, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany),  (n = 7), and  (n = 6) field isolates of avian origin, representing part of the bacterial strain collection of the Institute of Food Quality and Food Safety, were used for the experiments. Bacterial strains were stored at 80C and cultivated on charcoal cefoperazone desoxycholate agar plates (Qxoid, Wesel, Germany) at 41.51C for 48 h under microaerobic conditions (5% O, 10% CO, 85% N). For the culture-based enumeration of cells, 10-fold serial dilutions from 10 to 10 were prepared from bacterial suspensions. For each dilution, aliquots of 0.1 ml were spread on at least 10 agar plates. Colonies were counted after 48 h of incubation from agar plates containing 1 to 300 colonies. For the inactivation of , cells were heat-killed at 70C for 15 min in a water bath as previously described .
