Members of the Rel/NF-B family of transcription factors are key regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses and several cellular processes, including survival, growth, and proliferation ,. In mammals, the Rel family consists of five members, c-Rel, p65 (RelA), RelB, NF-B1 (p50/p105), and NF-B2 (p52/p100), that bind DNA as homodimers and heterodimers through a conserved N-terminal Rel homology region (RHR) . Rel dimers are often maintained in an inactive state by cytoplasmic association with IB proteins . Cell activation leads to signal transduction cascades that result in the phosphorylation and degradation of the IBs, allowing rapid nuclear translocation and DNA binding of the Rel dimers.
