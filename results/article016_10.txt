Cortical and subcortical parcellations provide the ROIs that are used as network nodes in CVU. In CVU, parcellations are displayed as nodes located on or near the cortical surface. It is possible to specify parcellations in three ways: as parcels of surface vertices, collections of voxels, or ROI coordinate centers described in a stereotaxic space. Parcellations are specified by specifying a  file and several  files depending on the method. Surface files store geometric information about the morphometry of the cortex, can be created using FreeSurfer, an open source imaging analysis suite (), and can be specified in either the native FreeSurfer format or the more general GIFTI format. In order to display the parcellation on the surface, it is necessary (but not required to run the program) to additionally provide a 44 registration matrix in any matrix format between the parcellation volume and the anatomical surface space.
