One challenge facing all combinatorial approaches to study metabolic network behavior is the sheer size of the space that can be explored. In the core network, simulating every combination of major and minor restriction across every reaction would result in 10 scenarios, many of which would be redundant. To reduce the combinatorial space when simultaneously modifying multiple reactions, we applied the Constrictor framework to restrict sets of metabolic reactions in various functional classes. The metabolic network is divided into fourteen functional classes, including glycolysis, the TCA cycle, pyruvate metabolism, anaplerotic reactions, oxidative phosphorylation, and ethylene production, among others (refer to Table S2 in  for complete listing of reactions in each class). Sets of four to nine reactions were modified simultaneously in the core and genome scale networks, resulting in hundreds to thousands of expression states per study. The results of this assessment (using major and minor modifications of 20% and 80% baseline, respectively) in several functional classes are shown in . As found through individual reaction modification, a set of the expression states targeting glycolysis increase ethylene yield in the core model and in the model iJO1366, while restrictions to other subsystems decrease yield or create unsolvable bottlenecks. For most subsystems, the results were found to be consistent across models (e.g. for L-arginine biosynthesis, Exchange, TCA cycle), except for oxidative phosphorylation, in which case the core model was more heavily impacted (86% decrease in yields for some expression states) than either of the genome scale models. In iAF1260, none of the subsystems predicted yield increases for 20% and 80% restrictions, which is consistent with the results in , where the highest yielding solutions were obtained by directly restricting glucose exchange (GLCtex) to 70% or 80% of baseline.
