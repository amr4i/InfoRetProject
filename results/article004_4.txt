The concentrations of the CYP substrates and their metabolites were quantified using a Waters 2695 separation module HPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, Massachusetts, USA) coupled to a Quattro micro API triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, Massachusetts, USA) with an electrospray ionization source. The samples were separated on a HyPURITY C column (150 mm2.1 mm, 5 m, Thermo, USA) with a C security guard column (4.0 mm3.0 mm, ID 5 m). The mobile phases consisted of 20 mM ammonium formate and acetonitrile at a ratio of 60:40. Aliquots of 20 L were injected at a mobile phase flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Multiple reaction monitoring was performed in the positive mode. The transitions are listed in . The mass spectra of the metabolites formed in the incubations were identical to those of the corresponding authentic standards.
