Here, we describe the construction and application of a fluorescence-based reporter of transcription from the P promoter to examine the regulation of the Pdu operon with respect to Pdu MCP formation. We first confirm that this transcriptional reporter correlates with MCP formation as assessed by microscopy and biochemical techniques. Using this reporter, we discover that 1,2-PD is sufficient for MCP formation in various rich media, in addition to the previously-reported MCP-inducing NCE minimal media. We then investigate the role of the transcription factor PocR and find it to be a necessary component of the regulation of MCP formation. Furthermore, we find that overexpression of PocR confers MCP formation and function, even in the absence of 1,2-PD and in the presence of glucose, which normally represses expression.
