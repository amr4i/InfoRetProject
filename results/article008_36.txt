Control charts, on the other hand, are especially useful for continuous optimization (reducing variation) and control of processes which already have been brought to acceptable levels of performance. Some types of control charts like CUSUM and EWMA charts are very sensitive to small shifts in process mean over time. These charts are useful for continuous monitoring of critical outcome measures that have been optimized and stabilised in advance in order to detect process degradation as quickly as possible. Mohammed provides several useful examples on the construction and use of control charts in healthcare .
