Installation of CVU requires the installation of a scientific python distribution such as Enthought Canopy () or Anaconda () which satisfies most of CVU's dependencies. CVU has been tested with both Anaconda and Enthought Canopy and works fully in both python environments. After installing the scientific python distribution, it is necessary to install CVU as well as three additional dependencies: bctpy, MNE-python , and nibabel (). Use of an installer such as easy-install from python's setuptools modules is recommended to install CVU and its dependencies. A launcher script is provided alongside the source code to run the program.
