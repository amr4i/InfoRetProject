The  was originally proposed by Swed and Eisenhart for testing the randomness of a sequence . If the number of runs is too small or too large, it is an indication that the sequence is not random, e.g. positively or negatively autocorrelated. Especially, if the number is too small it will indicate that the process centre may be shifting. To do the runs test one must either do some rather complicated calculations or look up the limits for the expected number of runs in tables based on the total number of runs in the sequence and the number of items of each kind. Simplified tables for use with run charts have been developed for run charts up to 60 data points , . For more than 60 data points, the limits can be calculated using the normal approximation of the runs distribution function .
