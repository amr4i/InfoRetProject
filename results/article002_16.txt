We again used fluorescence microscopy to verify the formation of MCPs in  expressing the encapsulation reporter PduP-GFP. We observed punctate fluorescence for strains grown in LB 1,2-PD similar to the puncta observed in strains grown in NCE 1,2-PD, but not in strains grown in LB without 1,2-PD (). Similar results were seen in strains expressing PduP-GFP when grown in the rich media 2xYT and Terrific Broth (see Fig. S5 in ). When viewed by TEM, we observed no apparent morphological differences between MCPs purified from  expressing PduP-GFP grown in LB 1,2-PD when compared to MCPs purified from the same strain grown in NCE 1,2-PD (). A western blot against GFP indicated that purified MCPs from  grown in LB continued to encapsulate heterologous proteins ().
