The CYP isoform-specific probe reactions used were phenacetin O-deethylation (for CYP1A2), coumarin 7-hydroxylation (for CYP2A6), tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (for CYP2C9), metoprolol -hydroxylation (for CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation (for CYP2E1), S-Mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation (for CYP2C19) and midazolam 1-hydroxylation (for CYP3A4). The kinetic study of MH was studied with HLMs, an incubation mixture that consisted of MH (as a substrate), the HLMs (0.5 mg/mL) or CYP isoforms (10 pmol) and 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in a total volume of 0.2 mL was pre-warmed for 5 min at 37C without (control). The inhibitory effects of MH on the activities of seven different CYP isoforms were studied with the HLMs (and the expressed CYPs, when required), multiple concentrations of MH (as an inhibitor) were included in the above incubation mixture system. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mg/mL triphosphopyridine nucleotide (NADPH). The final incubations were performed in a shaking water bath (37C) for 30 min. The incubations were performed in triplicates, and the incubation conditions specific to each CYP isoform were within the linear range for the velocity of the reaction (the incubation time as well as the substrate and protein concentrations). All the reagents were dissolved in methanol, and the final solvent concentration in all incubations (including controls) was 1%. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.2 mL ice-cold acetonitrile containing irbesartan (114.9 ng/mL) as the internal standard. The samples were vortexed for 5 min. After centrifugation (12000g for 10 min), the supernatants were transferred and aliquots of 20 L were injected into the HPLC-MS/MS system for analysis.
