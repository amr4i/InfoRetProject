Acceptable RNA degradation over the course of sample transport needs to be assessed through the lens of clinical relevance. A VL in whole blood or plasma of 1,000 copies/mL is recommended by the 2013 consolidated WHO HIV treatment guidelines as the threshold by which to define virological failure . Thus, in certain cases where VLs fall close to the 1,000 copies/mL threshold, a decline of>0.5 log in RNA stability may lead to incorrect clinical management decisions. According to a multi-country VL assessment of 21,909 adults, only 4.4% had VL results between 1,0005,000 copies/mL in routine VL testing, with an even smaller percentage falling within 0.5 log of the failure threshold . Further clarity on acceptable thresholds for degradation is needed, particularly at lower (<3,000 copies/mL) VL values. In our analysis, we considered declines of greater than 0.5 log copies/mL to be clinically relevant, consistent with the literature.
