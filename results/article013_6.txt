We purified the active compound that inhibited LPS-induced TNF- mRNA expression from gentian root extracts using the inhibitory activity-guided fractionation method (). The major compound in the most active fraction was identified by LC-TOFMS and NMR as gentiolactone (). To examine its cytotoxicity, we cultured RAW264.7 cells with gentiolactone for 24 hours and found no effects on cell viability or growth (). Gentiolactone significantly suppressed the expression of TNF- () and iNOS (), and Cox-2 () at concentrations of 100 M, 100 M and 500 M, respectively (). Moreover, gentiolactone inhibited the LPS-induced accumulation of TNF- protein (). Kwak  reported that gentianine, an anti-inflammatory compound contained in , inhibited an LPS-induced increase in IL-6 and TNF- in rat sera . We used LC-TOFMS to analyze the root extracts of  for gentianine, but did not detect this compound in the most active purified fraction (data not shown). Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect observed in gentian roots was due to the effect of gentiolactone and not gentianine.
