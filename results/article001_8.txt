Studies measured RNA degradation in EDTA whole blood (n = 6), EDTA plasma (n = 3) , , , and PPT whole blood (n = 1)  (). All included studies were controlled studies with matched blood samples drawn from the same individuals. Populations included ART nave patients (n = 4) , , ,  and mixed or unspecified treatment populations (n = 5) , . All studies examined RNA stability in the laboratory, rather than field conditions. Six of the nine studies were published prior to 2000, and all were conducted in the United States and Europe. Each study reported storage conditions for both the experimental and control arm.
