A docking study was performed using a LigandFit module in the Discovery Studio 2.1 version (Accelrys). The structure of the top1 protein has been solved only in the closed form, when it is fully embracing the DNA, and no information is available concerning its possible conformation in the absence of the substrate. The X-ray structure of top1 in complex with DNA was taken (PDB entry code: 1K4S)  and refined as follows. The bound DNA substrate was removed to generate a pseudo open state of top1 and the phosphorylated Tyr723 was modified to a nonphosphorylated state. The modified protein structure was subjected to minimization using Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods with backbone constraint to allow side chains to find their proper orientations. Previously, the structure of top1 without DNA substrate was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations  where an X-ray structure of human top1 with the elimination of 22-bp DNA duplex oligonucleotide was used as a starting configuration. The modeling result indicated that the protein undergoes a large conformational change due to linkage between core sub-domains I (a.a. 215-232 and 320-433) and III (a.a. 434-635) which opens up leaving the rearrangement in the orientation of the protein domains, while their secondary and tertiary structures are maintained. Accordingly, the DNA contact surface of the pseudo open state of top1 generated in our approach is proper for docking simulation. The structure of CFS1686 was then drawn into the Discovery Studio package with a CHARMm force field and minimized using Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods. The docking scoring function used in this study considers two energy terms, the internal energy of the ligand and the interaction energy of the ligand with the receptor. A higher positive score means a better docking behavior.
