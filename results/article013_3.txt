The present study was aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of the anti-inflammatory effect of roots of the Japanese gentian, . We found that a methanol extract of  roots inhibited LPS-induced expression of TNF-, iNOS, and Cox-2 in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, activity-guided fractionation of root extracts identified gentiolactone as the active compound: TNF- expression was inhibited by gentiolactone but not by gentiopicroside or swertiamarin. These results indicate that inhibition of TNF-, iNOS, and Cox-2 expression by gentiolactone is one of the mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory properties of  roots.
