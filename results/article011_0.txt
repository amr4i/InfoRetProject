Human topoisomerase type 1 (Top1), a member of the topoisomerase family, is responsible for DNA topological problems associated with supercoiling . Top1 catalyzes single-stranded DNA cleavage and relegation, required to relax DNA supercoiling generated by replication, transcription and chromatin remodeling . Mechanically, this enzyme performs its function by first forming a phosphotyrosine intermediate between the tyrosine of Top1 and the phosphate of the DNA backbone, resulting in a DNA break . Then, the 5 end of the break strand rotates around the intact strand to unwind the supercoils, and the break strand is religated to free tyrosine .
