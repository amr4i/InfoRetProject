The functional connectome is characterized by statistical regularities between spontaneous neural activity in different regions, typically collecting in the resting state. Resting state fMRI is a common choice to examine functional connectivity because resting state fMRI networks are robust across subjects, such as the default mode network which disappears during task activity, as well as other networks including the ventral and dorsal attentional networks, the somatosensory networks, and others , , . Resting functional connectivity can easily be calculated by correlating ROI timeseries produced by open-source software packages such as AFNI , FSL , and the FS-FAST toolbox in FreeSurfer.
