The V(D)J recombination generates antibody and T cell receptor diversity , .  and  (, ) were identified as activators of V(D)J recombination in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts grown on an artificial substrate . Cotransfection of  and  into fibroblasts synergistically activates V(D)J recombination , and both Rag-1 and Rag-2 proteins are sufficient to perform V(D)J recombination, which requires DNA nicking (double-strand breaks) and hairpin formation at an early stage . Moreover, it is established that  and  play a crucial role in lymphoid cell development. Both - and -deficient mice lack mature B and T lymphocytes because of the blockage of lymphocyte differentiation early in development , . In humans,  mutations cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with a complete absence of both T and B cells (T-B-SCID) by a complete block of T and B cell differentiation and Omenn syndrome and granulomas by impaired V(D)J recombination .

Currently, SCID model mice, including -deficient mice, are widely used in research. Even more severely immunodeficient models based on SCID mice, such as the nonobese diabetic/shi-scid (NOD/SCID), NOG (NOD/shi-scid/null), NSG (NOD/scid/), BALB/c Rag-2, and NOD/SCID/huBLT strains, are also used as a source for the xenotransplantation of human tissues and cells . Immunodeficient mice lacking T, B, natural killer (NK) cells, and CD122 plasmacytoid dendritic cells permit and maintain human cell grafts, such as hematopoietic stem cells and hepatocytes . Therefore, humanized mice, with functional human hematopoietic, immune systems, and liver can be developed by transplantation of these mice with human hematopoietic stem cells or human hepatocytes , . Advanced research on human-specific viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr virus, dengue fever, and hepatitis C virus, have been conducted using these humanized mice .
