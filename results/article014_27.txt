A sequence alignment of the three  co-chaperonins  shows that, unlike the Cpn10-like domains of Cpn20, Cpn10(1) and Cpn10(2) both lack a roof loop. Furthermore, Cpn20, Cpn10(1) and Cpn10(2) vary slightly in the sequences of their mobile loops. These differences may affect the affinity of the co-chaperonin to the chaperonin and influence the size of the formed cavity for substrate folding. A combination of the different properties of each co-chaperonin homolog with the various possible oligomeric arrangements may allow for greater flexibility of protein refolding in chloroplasts. We hypothesize that the ability to adapt to specific substrates can be modulated by changes in the Cpn10/Cpn20 composition.
