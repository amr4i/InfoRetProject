Banana is one of the most important tropical fruits worldwide . Its production is heavily constrained by Fusarium wilt, a lethal disease in banana plants ( spp.) that is caused by  f. sp.  , . Banana Fusarium wilt probably originated in Southeast Asia, but was first reported in Australia , . Four physiological races of  have been reported to infect banana and eventually lead to Fusarium wilt of leaves . However, only two races,  race 1 (F1) and race 4 (F4), have been shown to endanger banana production in China. F1 is a weakly virulent species that mainly infects the  Spp. Longyajiao and Fenjiao varieties. By contrast, F4 is strongly virulent and infects almost all banana varieties , . The first internal symptom of Fusarium wilt is a reddish brown discoloration in the xylem that then spreads to feeder roots . Vascular discoloration progresses to the rhizome, then joins the cortex, and ultimately proceeds up to large portions of the pseudostem. In severely affected 4monthold plants, the older leaves turn yellow or split longitudinally, and then, the young leaves entirely collapse , .
