To date, all published work involving endogenous expression of MCPs in  use No-Carbon E (NCE) minimal medium for growth. However, the growth rate of  is much slower in NCE media than in rich media (see Fig. S3 in ), creating additional barriers to effectively using MCPs in research and industry. We investigated whether activation of the P promoter is inhibited in rich media that is not supplemented with glucose using the P-GFP transcriptional reporter plasmid, starting with the common growth medium LB. A flow cytometry time course showed increased fluorescence upon addition of 1,2-PD for strains grown in LB (, see also Fig. S1B in ). This increased fluorescence occurred on a similar time scale when compared to strains grown in NCE 1,2-PD.
