In conclusion, we showed that primary human immune cells, especially CD1c DCs, are highly sensitive to LPS and can be activated by LPS concentrations as low as 0.02 ng/ml. This observation is of high significance because 0.02 ng LPS is equivalent to the amount of endotoxin impurities that may be present in 100 ng recombinant protein. Hence, the amounts of endotoxin impurities found in commercially available recombinant proteins might be sufficient to activate immune cells. Even if the LPS impurities alone do not affect those cells, it has to be considered that low LPS concentrations together with other types of stimuli (e.g. cytokines or NOD-like receptor ligands) could have synergistic effects  and thus produce erroneous data. To avoid endotoxin contamination that may compromise research experiments, we recommend working with proteins that have been expressed under largely endotoxin-free conditions. This includes either expression of recombinant proteins by non-bacterial expression systems like HEK293 cells, or the use of a new line of competent cells called ClearColi, an  strain possessing a genetically modified LPS that does not induce inflammatory responses in human cells. Although other potential bacterial components (e.g. peptidoglycans or lipoproteins) may contaminate recombinant proteins, LPS remains the main concern due to its heat stability , binding affinity to different surfaces , and its ability to elicit immune responses at very low concentrations . Therefore, we strongly advise using the methods mentioned in ,  and  to ensure that all proteins used are devoid of endotoxin impurities, especially when working with immune cells that are highly sensitive to LPS.
