It is surprising that morphologically normal compartments, which require a set number of shell-forming proteins, can form even when concentrations of the shell-forming proteins depart far from native levels. Studies of other MCP systems will shed light on the robust mechanism of MCP formation observed here. The Eut MCP, for example, is regulated by a positive transcriptional regulator EutR that is transcribed at the 3 end of the Eut operonpolycistron, instead of divergently transcribed on another cistron as is PocR. If other MCPs also form morphologically normal compartments in response to overexpression of their transcriptional regulators, this would suggest that post-transcriptional regulation is important to the assembly mechanism. We show that the combination of measuring transcriptional output and phenotypic observations is a powerful approach for characterizing gene regulation. The results presented in this paper provide further insight into the natural regulation of Pdu MCP formation in , and are an important step towards utilizing MCPs as a biotechnological tool.
