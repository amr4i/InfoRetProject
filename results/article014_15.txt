In light of the above research, we examined the possibility that Cpn10(1) acquires functionality by assembling with the other  chloroplast co-chaperonins. For this purpose, we carried out refolding experiments using GroEL or Cpn60 (10 M), which was supplemented with a constant concentration of inactive Cpn10(1) (20 M) and increasing concentrations of Cpn20 (0.62520 M). Since Cpn10(1) alone was not able to assist chaperonin in mediating protein folding at any concentration, we assumed that any increase in the refolding yield above that of Cpn20 alone, would be due to the formation of mixed hetero-oligomers.
