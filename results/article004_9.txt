In pilot experiments ( determination), we noted that MH markedly inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, whereas its effect on the remaining CYPs (CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4) was minimal. Therefore, Dixon plots for the inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 were determined by incubating the substrate probe at multiple concentrations with or without the test inhibitor at multiple concentrations with the HLMs and cofactors. The inhibition data obtained from the pilot experiments were used as a guide to generate appropriate probe substrate and test inhibitor concentrations for the determination of the  values for each CYP isoform. The isoform-specific probe substrate concentrations used were 3 to 100 M phenacetin for CYP1A2 and 15 to 120 M S-mephenytoin for CYP2C19. The MH concentrations used were 0 to 100 M.
