If the process of interest shows only random variation, the data points will be randomly distributed around the median. Random meaning that we cannot know if the next data point will fall above or below the median, but that the probability of each event is 50%, and that the data points are independent. Independence means that the position of one data point does not influence the position of the next data point, that is, data are not auto-correlated. If the process shifts, these conditions are no longer true and patterns of non-random variation may be detected by statistical tests.
