Further directions for research and software development may involve the use of new visualization strategies or improvements to existing visualizations. Incorporating useful visualization features from other software packages, such as interactive annotations, into one single software package is a possible direction of future software development. The development of novel visualization methods for interpreting complex networks is an important direction of future work. Development of new software that makes use of existing algorithms in scientific visualization is also important. For instance, some representations of circular ideograms similar to the circle view in CVU utilize a hierarchical bundling strategy, in which similar edge splines are clustered together, reducing visual clutter . However, we are only aware of one software implementation of this technique  in the Functional Brain Connectivity Explorer , a tool with many similarities to CVU. The Functional Brain Connectivity Explorer, however, is only intended for the analysis of resting state fMRI data and requires volume-based brain atlases.

CVU is limited in the character of the networks that can be visualized. Only single-edged, undirected networks can be visualized. Methods of effective connectivity, corresponding to visualizations of directed graphs, are not currently supported. Likewise, multigraph networks which have multiple values per edge (e.g., EEG/MEG networks with separate edges for each frequency band) are not supported. Moreover, CVU's networks are static; no visualizations exist to depict the robustness or dynamic natures of networks collected from modalities such as EEG/MEG. The development of new easily interpretable visualizations for directed networks, multigraphs, and dynamically changing network structures is an important direction of future work.
