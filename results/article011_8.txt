Plasmid pUC18 DNA was digested by Hind  to expose the 5 overhang end. Then [-32P]dATP was added onto its 5-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Labeled DNA was diluted to a concentration of 100,000 C.P.M to achieve its best activity. [-32P] labeled pUC18 was incubated with human recombinant topoisomerase I and various concentrations of CFS-1686 or CPT in reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA and 15 mg/ml BSA) for 20 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by adding 10% SDS to a final concentration of 5%, and two volumes of loading dye (80% (vol/vol) formamide, 10 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% (wt/vol) bromophenol blue and 0.25% (wt/vol) xylene cyanol) were added. Before loading into wells, the reactions were heated at 95C for 5 min to denature recombinant topoisomerase I. Then aliquots of every reaction were loaded into 6% natural gel (12 ml 40% acrylamide gel, 12 ml 5 TBE, 300 l APS, 20 l TEMED in 36 ml DDHO), and run at constant voltage of 300 V for 6 hours. Afterward, gels were dried at 80C for 60 min and then exposed to imaging plate (FUJIFILM) and scanned by imaging systems (FUJIFILM).
