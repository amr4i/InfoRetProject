Malate dehydrogenase (35 M MDH - Roche) was denatured in 4.5 M urea and 5 mM DTT for 3 hours at room temperature. The refolding reaction was carried out in two steps. First, MDH was rapidly diluted to 0.5 M into a refolding solution containing 10 M GroEL (or chloroplast Cpn60) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT and incubated for 15 min at 37C to form the chaperonin-MDH binary complex. Next, the refolding of MDH was initiated by adding different concentrations of co-chaperonins or co-chaperonin mixtures (as stated in Figures) and 5 mM ATP. After a 30 min incubation at 37C, 10 l aliquots were assayed for MDH activity by adding 990 l of reaction mixture containing 150 mM K-phosphate pH 7.6, 10 mM DTT, 0.28 mM NADH and 0.5 mM oxaloacetate and monitoring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm.
