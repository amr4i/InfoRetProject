The fluorescence was measured using instrument settings appropriate for excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm. (POLARstar Omega BMG LAB tech). A baseline recording of 7 cycles was recorded prior to stimulation with the agonist (10 M capsaicin for TRPV1, 100 M menthol for TRPM8, and 100 M AITC for TRPA1). The corresponding antagonist (10 M Ruthenium Red for TRPV1 and TRPA1, 100 M AMTB for TRPM8) was added for the blockade. The changes in fluorescence intensity were recorded during 15 cycles more. DMSO, at the higher concentration used in the experiment, was added to the control wells.
