The roots were harvested and dried naturally at room temperature. A 10 g sample of dried gentian roots was powdered and then extracted with MeOH (100 ml) under reflux for four hours. The 2.3 g of MeOH extract was subjected to a preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (PLC761; GL Science Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Gentiolactone (12.1 mg) was separated on an InertSustain ODS-3 column (20.0 mm dia. 250 mm; GL Science Inc.) with gradient elution of water and MeOH (10 to 40% of MeOH in 30 min, 40% of MeOH for 5 min) at a flow rate of 15 mL/min and detection at 240 nm.
