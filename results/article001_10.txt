For EDTA whole blood, six studies assessed RNA stability at 4C and room temperature (25C), with time points at zero, six, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours (). HIV RNA remained stable for all measured time points until 168 hours at 4C with 95% confidence . For the EDTA whole blood samples stored at room temperature (25C) beyond the established stability threshold, four time points were within the acceptable threshold for RNA stability, and another four had a point estimate that suggested stability, but the confidence intervals overlapped the 0.5 log degradation threshold. The latest time point to maintain statistically significant stability according to the pre-specified criteria was at 72 hours . An additional study at room temperature found that 72.4% of the samples measured had less than 0.2 log degradation, with 96.5% at less than 0.5 log degradation after 24 hours . The matrix of RNA stability in EDTA whole blood and plasma over time is indicated in .
