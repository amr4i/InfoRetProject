In data sheets accompanying commercially produced recombinant proteins, the amount of bacterial contamination is usually stated in endotoxin units (EU), and most suppliers guarantee contamination levels of less than 1 EU, which is approximately equivalent to 100 pg of  LPS per microgram of recombinant protein . Based on that level, protein preparations at concentrations ranging from 101000 ng/ml may be contaminated with 1-100 pg LPS. Because the vast majority of  studies have reported on endotoxin effects induced by concentrations between 1 and 100 ng/ml, the current study investigates the effects of very low endotoxin concentrations ranging from 0.0022 ng/ml on human immune cells, as these concentrations are equivalent to the amount of residual contamination present in recombinant proteins.
