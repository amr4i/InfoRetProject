For quantification of stain intensities, images from experimental and control embryos to be compared were all assembled into one composite Photoshop (typically five controls on left side and five experimental embryos on right side) file, merged into one single layer separate from the background layer. Using the Photoshop "Levels" tool composite layers that did not fully use the 8-bit intensity range were adjusted linearly taking great care not to saturate pixels. The composite was flattened, and converted to grayscale (8 bit). The grayscale image was then inverted using the Image - Adjustments - Invert tool. These composite images were saved as TIFF files. TIFF files were opened using ImageJ 1.48o (64bit). For each individual image in the composite, the equivalent anatomical areas of WISH signal were marked using the freehand selection tool, drawn using a graph tablet (Bamboo Fun CTH-461; WACOM). Using the ImageJ Analyze - Measure command, the area as well as mean, minimum and maximum grey values were determined. Data were controlled such that maximum grey values did not exceed 254 (to exclude saturation). Data were transferred into Excel:mac2011.
