While the s were qualitatively informative and help to address whether inhibition had occurred, their values were of limited use because they could be influenced by the substrate concentration selected, and it might not be accurate to use these parameters for the quantitative prediction of drug interactions . Therefore, we performed additional experiments designed to estimate the  values. The preliminary inhibition data generated from a single probe substrate reaction were used to simulate the appropriate range of substrate and inhibitor concentrations for use in the construction of Dixon plots for the inhibition of the CYP isoforms by MH in the HLMs, from which precise  values were estimated.
