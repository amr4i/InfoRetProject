To investigate whether stimulation of different immune cells with minimal LPS concentrations would also result in the up-regulation of typical co-stimulatory molecules, we analysed the surface expression of CD40, CD80, CD83 and CD86 by flow cytometry (). Again, THP-1 cells were the least sensitive cell type and required 2 ng/ml LPS to show minor changes in surface marker expression. Similar to our observations with cytokine secretion, moDCs required 2 ng/ml LPS to induce expression of all activation markers as well, but the changes in surface marker expression were again of much higher significance than in THP-1 cells. Whereas monocytes are highly sensitive to LPS and showed up-regulation of CD40 and CD80 in response to 0.02 ng/ml LPS, CD1c DCs seem to be even more sensitive, as they additionally expressed CD86 at these minimal LPS concentrations.
