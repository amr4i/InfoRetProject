Spleen, MLNs, and thymus samples were collected from both wild-type and -deficient neonatal piglets. These tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and embedded in paraffin blocks. Thereafter, tissue samples were cut at 4 m and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Histologic sections were evaluated under a microscope.
