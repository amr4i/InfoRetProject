In mammalian reproduction, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) production from pituitary gonadotrope cells is critical for the regulation of gonadal functions such as steroidogenesis and gametogenesis , . LH and FSH are heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of a common alpha subunit and a beta subunit which is unique to each hormone . Transcription of  and  is one of the rate limiting steps in the production of the mature hormones ,  and is tightly controlled by a complex network of hormonal signaling pathways including those activated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and activin .
