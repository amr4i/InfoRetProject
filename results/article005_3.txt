In this report, we introduce Constrictor, an FBA strategy to analyze the impact of various degrees of inhibitory effects of genetic mutations observed during genome engineering experiments on the performance of biochemical networks. This is achieved by restricting flux bounds by Minor and Major levels below the steady state level in order to simulate different extents of inhibition caused by mutations. Constrictor generates unique  strains, each representing an expression state, or a combination of gene expression levels (). Sets of expression states are based on percentage reductions in flux, such that the impact of finely tuned gene repression can be studied rationally. Constrictor is employed to investigate heterologous ethylene production. Ethylene is an important intermediate compound that can be converted into a multitude of products, including plastics like polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinylchloride, as well as fuels like gasoline, diesel, and ethanol . Biological synthesis of ethylene is a promising avenue to reduce fossil fuel requirements and industrial emissions associated with chemical manufacturing.
