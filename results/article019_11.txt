The channels were stably expressed in eukaryotic cells, and a Ca fluorographic assay used to monitor their activity upon instillation of their respective agonists in the absence and presence of compound  at 50 M. As illustrated in , only the activity of the TRPA1 channels was selectively blocked up to 85% at this concentration of . No significative effect was recorded for the other thermoTRPs. A dose-response curve reveals that compound  displayed an IC of 2.6 M, indicating that compound  is a moderate antagonist of TRPA1 channels (). The inhibitory activity of compound  was further demonstrated electrophysiologically as evidenced by the blockade of the AITC-evoked ionic currents ( and  in the presence and in the absence of extracellular Ca). Collectively, these findings indicate that TRPA1 is a molecular target of compound , and could participate in the antinociceptive effect showed in the writing test.

We have described the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new paracetamol analogs derived from an adamantane scaffold. Compounds  and  represent attractive leads to be developed since they show an improved antinociceptive effect compared to paracetamol. In addition, adamantane derivatives have proved to be very biocompatible, so possible toxic effects due to chronic treatment should not be expected.
