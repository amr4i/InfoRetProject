Although paracetamol (4-hydroxyacetanilide, acetyl--aminophenol, acetaminophen, APAP)  was found to be an effective analgesic more than a century ago, its mechanism of action is complex and the subject of continuous research mainly due to its extensive metabolism in animals and humans .

Several reports have described pathways of APAP to exert its analgesic activity. Unlike non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), whose analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects are related to their inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), paracetamol is a weak anti-inflammatory agent with an absence of COX-related adverse effects . In the brain and spinal cord paracetamol is metabolized by fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH) to -arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404). AM404 is a known activator of the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1)  and the cannabinoid CB receptor system  both of which confer analgesia in the central nervous system. The main drawback found in the use of paracetamol is the mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) . APAP metabolites (e.g. N-acetyl--benzoquinoneimine (NAPQ1) have centered the attention because of their toxic actions causing hepatotoxicity . Many articles have been devoted to this topic  and different attempts have been made to circumvent this problem. For instance, 3-hydroxyacetanilide is non hepatotoxic because the oxygen atoms of quinones can only be at 1,2-,, or, 4-positions,  . Other authors have designed new analgesics derived from the paracetamol metabolite (AM404) having an anandamide chain instead of the acetamido group . The replacement of the methyl group by saccharin or an open form of it (SCP-1 and SCP-123) improves considerably its water solubility . A proline prodrug was developed with this purpose  and a paracetamol analogue known as propacetamol is currently in the market. Note that paracetamol presents polymorphism . Whereas researchers have been trying to avoid the formation of the metabolite responsible for APAP toxicity designing non-hepatotoxic paracetamol analogues , a new antinociceptive mechanism driven by activation of TRPA1 in the spinal cord by APAP metabolites such as NAPQ1 has been reported .

In August 2013, the FDA warned of rare but serious skin reaction associated with paracetamol. Despite the fact that it has been on the market for decades, paracetamol can be considered a standalone drug of which no effective analogues are known . Some compounds which have been reported include the -methyl derivative, and -(1-indazolo-5-yl), -(4-hydroxy)acetamides and recently pyridinol-fused ring derivatives, but in all of them, the aromatic ring is present .

The approach proposed in the present paper is totally different being based on the hypothesis that the replacement of the phenyl ring of paracetamol by an adamantane ring with the same substituents in 1,4-positions, will yield analogues of paracetamol. Adamantyl derivatives are found in medicinal chemistry in very different domains . Adamantane is one of the few singular hydrocarbon moieties that have been successfully employed in pharmaceutical industry. The most popular hit is amantadine used for the treatment of influenza and Parkinson's disease . Related to analgesia and/or inflammation some analogues of -THC such as compound  have been reported () . Quinolone  binds selectively to the cannabinoid CB receptor being endowed with analgesic activity  . Some derivatives from  reported as P2X receptor antagonists acted as agents against rheumatoid arthritis . Amongst the carbohydrazides, the most interesting is  developed by Abbott . As can be seen, none of the structures represented in  is related to our compounds.

In this work we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of compounds ,  and  () in which the phenyl ring has been substituted by an adamantyl.

The preparation of compound  is summarized in . Commercially available 3-amino-1-adamantanol ()  was acetylated in water, the solvent of choice for green chemistry.

Compounds  and  were synthesized following the route summarized in  . These compounds were obtained after a reductive amination and in three steps from the commercially available 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone (). The synthesis was carried out using the pure enantiomer of the --methylbenzylamine and the 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone refluxing in absolute ethanol. The intermediate compound  was hydrogenated. This hydrogenation with the catalyst Pd/C 10% could have been performed in two steps, isolating the benzylamino derivatives, but it was preferred an overnight hydrogenation to yield compounds  and . The last synthetic step consisted of the acetylation in water of the mixture using the same conditions as for compound  yielding an  mixture of compounds  and  in a 7:3 ratio, with the E isomer being the major product. Compounds  and  were found in a paper by Gonzles-Nuez et al.  but with a different enriched mixture ( 75/25) and not separated for fully characterization. In our case, compounds  and  were purified by automated semipreparative LC-MS for their characterization.

The C and H NMR spectroscopy in DMSO- of the mixture of  and  is interesting. The signals were assigned taking into account that  was the major isomer (about 70%) and by means of 2D experiments. To check the assignments as well as the isomerism, we calculated the absolute shielding - (, ppm) at the GIAO/B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level and transform the absolute shielding into chemical shifts (, ppm, see ).

The analgesic activity of compounds  and the  mixture was compared to that of paracetamol and morphine in a model of visceral pain (). The intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of acetic acid (2%) induced a typical writhing reaction, characterized by a wave of contraction of the abdominal musculature followed by extension of the hind limbs. After acetic acid administration, mice were placed in individual transparent containers and, after 5 min, the number of writhes was counted during a 10 min period. In nave animals, the number of stretches induced by acetic acid was 25.40.8. Morphine (5 mg/kg, i.p.), an opioid accepted as the gold standard of analgesic drugs, notably decreased the number of writhes by 75%. Paracetamol (100 mg/kg), administered i.p. 30 minutes before acetic acid, was less effective than morphine reducing only by 40% the nociceptic behavior. Furthermore, a 2-fold increment in the paracetamol dose did not result in an increase of its analgesic effect in this pain model ().

Akin to the reference analgesic agents, compounds  and  were administered i.p. 30 minutes before the injection of acetic acid (). The solubility of these derivatives was significantly higher than paracetamol allowing their testing at higher doses, which is a desirable property. Both compounds ( and ) were able to induce a significant antinociceptive effect that was more potent for compound . As illustrated in , compound  displays a similar 40% antinociceptive activity to that recorded with paracetamol. This analgesic effect of compound  displayed some dose-dependency and saturated at 200 mg/kg. In contrast, compound  exhibited stronger analgesic activity than compound , and a clear dose-dependent analgesic activity that saturated at 750 mg/kg. At saturation, compound  displays an analgesic efficacy significantly higher than paracetamol and similar to morphine. Taken together, these results suggest that compound  is a more potent analgesic than paracetamol.

We next investigated the mechanism of action underlying the analgesic activity of analogue . First, we evaluated a possible action on cannabinoid receptors. For this purpose, compound  was administered 30 minutes before the selective CB1 AM251 (3 mg/kg i.p.) and CB2 AM630 (1 mg/kg, i.p) antagonists, and the writhing test was carried out 30 minutes after the administration of the antagonists. Neither the CB1 nor the CB2 antagonist was able to block the antinociceptive activity of compound  (number of stretches 131 (AM251) and 15.51.7 (AM630). Thus, the cannabinoid system does not appear to play a significant role in the antinociception induced by the paracetamol derivatives  and .

An alternative mechanism that we evaluated was the potential inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1 or COX-2. Our findings indicate that, while paracetamol inhibited COX-2 with an IC of 7.081.62 mM, compound  did not affect the enzymatic activity at 10 mM. This result implies that inhibition of COX enzymes does not underlie the  analgesic activity of compound .

Because of the pivotal role of thermoTRP channels in pain transduction , we hypothesized that the analgesic activity of compound  may be due to a direct inhibition of some these channels. Among the thermoTRPs, TRPM8 (melastatin), TRPV1 (vanilloid) and TRPA1 (ankyrin) are the most validated in pain signaling. TRPV1 is considered a molecular integrator of noxious heat stimuli in nociceptors , TRPM8 is a pivotal sensor for cold stimuli, and TRPA1 is a unique sensor of noxious environmental stimuli . Therefore, we selected these channels to evaluate if any of them was the target of compound  ().

The channels were stably expressed in eukaryotic cells, and a Ca fluorographic assay used to monitor their activity upon instillation of their respective agonists in the absence and presence of compound  at 50 M. As illustrated in , only the activity of the TRPA1 channels was selectively blocked up to 85% at this concentration of . No significative effect was recorded for the other thermoTRPs. A dose-response curve reveals that compound  displayed an IC of 2.6 M, indicating that compound  is a moderate antagonist of TRPA1 channels (). The inhibitory activity of compound  was further demonstrated electrophysiologically as evidenced by the blockade of the AITC-evoked ionic currents ( and  in the presence and in the absence of extracellular Ca). Collectively, these findings indicate that TRPA1 is a molecular target of compound , and could participate in the antinociceptive effect showed in the writing test.

We have described the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new paracetamol analogs derived from an adamantane scaffold. Compounds  and  represent attractive leads to be developed since they show an improved antinociceptive effect compared to paracetamol. In addition, adamantane derivatives have proved to be very biocompatible, so possible toxic effects due to chronic treatment should not be expected.

The main result of the present communication is that phenyl ring, ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry, in some cases could be replaced by an adamantyl ring without loss but improvement of the biological properties. To the ,  and  positions of a phenyl ring correspond to 1,2, 1,3 and 1,4-substituents on an adamantyl ring. This is in agreement with our findings since the 1,4-derivative, with a similar substitution to that of paracetamol, has shown greater potency than the 1,3-derivative.

Even though more pharmacological research is needed (using TRPA1 agonists for example), compound , an analogue of paracetamol, able to block TRPA1 channel, is an interesting, new, antinociceptive drug.

The animals, CD-1 male mice (2527 g), were redistributed in groups, two of which were used as the control group. The remaining twelve groups were treated with paracetamol 100 and 200 mg/kg (two different groups), compound 5 (100, 200, 500 mg/kg) and compound 6a/b (250, 375, 500, 750 mg/kg). An additional group received morphine 5 mg/kg. All drugs were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered, 30 minutes before the algogen agent. Control mice were treated with 10 ml/kg of saline solution. Each group included 1012 animals; those animals showing behavioral alterations were previously discarded. Each animal was used only once. An observer who was unaware of the different treatments carried out the collection of data.

The experimental test used was the acetic acid writhing test. The effect of the i.p. administration of 10 ml/kg of acetic acid (2%) was measured by quantifying the number of writhing responses in the three groups of animals over a 10 minutes period. Responses were measured starting 5 minutes after the algogen agent was administered. The animals used were supplied by the animal house of Universidad Rey Juan Carlos. Room temperature was kept at 221C. A 12 hours light - dark cycle was started at 8:00 a.m., at constant humidity. All animals were given free access to food and water.

Experimental protocols used in this investigation were approved by the Ethical Committee of Rey Juan Carlos University and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain .

A COX inhibitor screening assay (kit 700100) was used to determine the activity of isolated ovine COX-1 and human recombinant COX-2 as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical Company, USA).

For fluorescence assays, cells expressing TRP channels (TRPV1-SH-SY5Y, TRPM8-HEK and TRPA1-IMR90) were seeded in 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) at a cell density of 40,000 cells 2 days before treatment. The day of treatment the medium was replaced with 100 L of the dye loading solution Fluo-4 NW supplemented with probenecid 2.5 mM. Then the compounds dissolved in DMSO were added at the desired concentrations and the plate(s) were incubated at 37C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO for 60 minutes.

The fluorescence was measured using instrument settings appropriate for excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm. (POLARstar Omega BMG LAB tech). A baseline recording of 7 cycles was recorded prior to stimulation with the agonist (10 M capsaicin for TRPV1, 100 M menthol for TRPM8, and 100 M AITC for TRPA1). The corresponding antagonist (10 M Ruthenium Red for TRPV1 and TRPA1, 100 M AMTB for TRPM8) was added for the blockade. The changes in fluorescence intensity were recorded during 15 cycles more. DMSO, at the higher concentration used in the experiment, was added to the control wells.

The degree of blockage (%) of TRP channel activity was calculated by:

Where:

 is the fluorescence after the addition of agonist in the presence of the compound,

 is the fluorescence before the addition of agonist in the presence of the compound,

 is the fluorescence after the addition of agonist in the absence of the compound,

 is the fluorescence before the addition of agonist in the absence of the compound.

The  factor was calculated using the following equation:

Where:

 is the mean of the maximum fluorescence in the presence of agonist,

 is the mean of the maximum fluorescence in the presence of agonist and antagonist.

The geometries of compounds ,  and  were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level and the corresponding frequencies (all 0) proved that they are minima. These geometries were reoptimized at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level. Absolute shieldings (, ppm) and SSCC (Hz) were calculated on these geometries using the GIAO approximation for the  values. The corresponding chemical shifts (, ppm) were obtained using the empirical transformation equations we have established for a large collection of compounds. The used equations transform calculated values in the gas phase to experimental values in solution (usually CDCl or DMSO-). See supplementary data.
