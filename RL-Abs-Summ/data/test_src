 "Well, let it pass, it don'tmatter now--this is my last month in this house, anyway, and no dickwill hear that I'm Devlin through.
" He stopped, as if bewildered,but only for a moment.
 Then he asked: "Which one of the Greeks did hetake?""Both," Skippy said quietly.
"_Both!_" Devlin was plainly beside himself and he made no furtherattempt to conceal it.
 He stepped back into the hall, waving his longarms from side to side.
 "He did, did he! So he took 'em both, eh? Well,I'll show .
 where's the note?""How'd we know?" Skippy retorted.
 "We looked for a ladder, that's all,n' it wouldn't be where there was a note, would it?"If Devlin heard that, he gave no sign.
 He stalked into his room and waseven then in possession of the note.
 While he read it, he ran his long,hairy fingers back and forth through his hair.
"His hair's wet, kid--awful wet!" Nickie whispered.
 "An' his feet, Nick--look at 'em--they're coveredwith mud! Looks like he's been walkin' through plenty.
"Nickie shivered, but they said no more for Devlin had already read thenote and was tearing it into a hundred pieces.
 Also, he was looking atthe boys and a hard, cold glitter was in his eyes.
"You boys still haven't told me what you had the bed up against thedoor for?" he asked, with a hint of cunning in his suddenly modulatedtones.
Skippy was quick to sense this and he gathered his wits to matchDevlin's.
 Na√Øvely, he answered: "Maybe it's sissy-like for guys to getscared, mister, but we was never so scared as we was tonight when wewas up in that attic.
 We was lookin' through one of those old trunksand all of a sudden we heard somebody runnin'.
""Yeah, runnin' like nobuddy's business," Nickie added, with narrowedeyes upon Devlin.
 "An' like he told us in his dream, who do we seestandin' down there like a ghost, but Timmy!"Devlin's face looked almost black, but he said nothing.
"Yeah, we was scared, an' how!" Skippy said excitedly.
 "It was rainin'so hard an' the wind was blowin' so we couldn't hear hardly nothin' hesaid.
""You couldn't?" Devlin's query was almost too eager.
Nickie sighed with understanding and Skippy went on, "All we heard himsay was somethin' bout somebody bein' hurt.
 Maybe it was him, I don'tknow.
 Anyway, mister, we told him we couldn't let him in 'cause Frostwas away an' we told him he better run an' go back where he come from.
So he stood there awhile an' said sump'n about a car stoppin' an' allof a sudden the wind blew our lantern out 'cause we opened the windowan' couldn't shut it again.
""Yeah, an' Timmy musta went away then," Nickie finished.
 "The kid an'me we calls n' calls so after I says to the kid, maybe we only imaginedit was Timmy, hah? We been talkin' so much bout the nightmare he hadthat night, I says I guess we had it on the brain.
 It was some spookyhere tonight with the storm an' all, an' a guy can imagine a lot.
""You must have imagined a terrible lot!" Devlin said gravely.
 "The lastI saw of Timmy Underwood, he was waving to me from the window of atrain bound for Montana.
"Skippy stood speechless and Nickie walked helplessly to the bed and satdown.
"I suppose the whole thing made you a little nervous," Devlin said,staring down at the dilapidated writing table.
 "This is aquiet place, specially during a storm.
 But boys your age being sonervous as to push the bed.
""We couldn't find no match to light a lantern," Skippy said, feelinglimp.
"Yeah, an' I didn't want no spooks creepin' in on me," Nickie added.
"Live ones, I ain't afraid of.
""Nonsense! The best thing you boys can do is to go to bed and forgetit.
 I'm a little tired myself.
" After a pause, he added: "I'm takingyou boys, somewhere in the morning so wake up early.
 Goodnight!"Skippy couldn't get the door closed quickly enough.
 He threw himself onthe bed exhausted.
 "Am I glad that's over!""Same here, kid," Nickie agreed in a faint voice.
 "Our little date withhim tomorra ain't worryin' me like what Frost's gonna say bout thatlock when he gets back.
""Keep your shirt on.
 From what Devlin's looked an' from what he ain'tsaid about Frost, makes me think there'll be plenty trouble between_them_ so the lock won't look big.
 Anyway, we can deny it, can't we?Frost's double-crossed Devlin a little, I think, so will Devlin believeall he says again, huh? Our word's as good as Frost's.
""Kid, I'm a dumb-bell again, ain't I? While you're makin' the old beanwork I'm worryin' bout Devlin's mitts.
" Suddenly he lowered his voicestill more and whispered close to Skippy's ear, "What's the idea sayin'we didn' hear nothin' that Timmy said?""We gotta outsmart _him_! While he thinks we ain't on to nothin', hewon't be so foxy.
 Take it from me, Nickie, if we tell him nothin' wegot a chance--not unless.
""What a guy!""If he thought we thought there was really sump'n phoney bout him an'Timmy tonight, we couldn't breathe no more without him knowin' it.
 He'sgonna be foxy anyhow, but he'd be worse if he knew what we was thinkin'an' I betcha I'm right.
""You didn't fall for that about him seein' Timmy off on that train forMontana, hah?""We seen Timmy down in the clearin'--we seen him with our own eyes,didn' we?""Devlin looked like a minister when he said he seen Timmy wavin' onthat, train.
 Could a guy be lyin' an' look like that?""That's why they call him Dean," Skippy murmured, thinking of whatCarlton Conne had told him of the man's record.
 "He fools people 'causehe looks like a saint.
 Sure, he can lie--he don't do nothin' else but.
""It's awful, kid, but I can't think what we saw was real--_it couldn'tbe_!""But the mud on his shoes an' his wet hair.
And when day dawned warm and clear, they had come no nearer to thetruth than that.
CHAPTER XXIVWAITINGDevlin had a change of mind during the intervening hours, and atbreakfast he announced with his usual gravity that they would not makethe trip that day after all.
 He had some important business to attendto first, he said, and would leave them alone that afternoon.
 On Mondayevening they would go.
He seemed not at all concerned about the attic but just before he wasleaving that afternoon, he started to remove the ladder.
"Aw, leave it there, won't you?" Skippy asked imploringly.
 "Nickie an'me, we get sick of the dark rooms downstairs an' up there we can playcards an' all without a light.
Devlin's cold, staring eyes glittered more than ever after he gave hisconsent and there was a calm about him when he went out that left theboys perplexed.
They rushed to the window when they heard him slam the metal door ofthe woodshed.
 Eagerly they watched while he stalked with measured stepstoward the barn.
 Then they saw him backing out slowly in a blue coupethat was distinctly second-hand.
"Another car!" Nickie gasped.
"Gee, I expected it, an' I didn't!" was Skippy's comment.
 "Did we hearTimmy say that old sedan went over into the lake, or didn't we?""We did _and how_! You're right, kid, it looks like I'm goofey aboutthat spook stuff.
 We won't argue about it no more.
 What we gonna do allday, hah?""Work on those bars," Skippy grinned.
 "Gee whiz, Nick, tell the truth,I didn't think we'd have the chance.
 I thought he had us where hewanted.
"Seven hours later, they were not so sure but that Devlin would betriumphant after all.
 They had worked sedulously during that time butthere was only a little give in the top bar and the boys were well nighdiscouraged.
Sitting atop the trunk they surveyed the bars ruefully.
 Another day wasdrawing to its close, another day that brought them nearer to the Fatewhich only Devlin held the key to.
 Skippy felt weary and sick.
"There's no use, I guess, Nick.
 It's comin' out like Timmy said--wecan't do a thing till he takes us outa here for our turn.
""Yeah, then we gotta use our beans an' scram.
 But it's got _me_, kid;we saw in that book how much money he expects from us.
 How can he getit when we're dead?""I dunno.
 We ain't gonna hash this mystery business all over again--I'mtoo blamed tired.
 All I'm sure of is that Devlin gets money for us an'sometime or other he'll wanta kill us for some reason.
 Timmy said itwas a trick about him shippin' us west, so that's the night he doesit--always at night, you know that.
 When that night comes for us, wejust gotta outguess him.
""An' it's about a month from the time he takes us to a sawbones,"Nickie said mournfully.
 "Well, if we can't do nothin' else about it,I'm gonna pull myself together.
 But one thing, I hope he takes ustogether--see.
 If you go first or I go--holy smoke, I can't stand it ifhe takes us separate.
 I'm scared I'll lose my nerve--you know it?""Forget it, Nick.
 Whatever he does, be foxy an' forget about me n' I'lldo the same.
 Gee whiz, from what Timmy said he don't tie you down--ifhe did that we wouldn't have a chance.
 Now quit worryin', an' let's getdown before he comes.
 I'll hide the things again an' maybe he'll be outa lotta the time an' we can try it again.
 If we keep pullin' on thembars we'll weaken 'em after awhile even if it's weeks.
