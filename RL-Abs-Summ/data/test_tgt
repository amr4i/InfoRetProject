""Yeah, weeks too late.
"Nickie's spirits rose considerably a little later.
 Devlin had come inwith a pail of chicken fricassee and an apple pie, announcing that hehad stopped at a lunch wagon to give the boys a treat.
 Skippy almostdecided that all his suspicions had been unfounded.
The problem was a tormenting one.
 Could anyone be so cruel? Devlin'sface, always a study, was no nearer revealing what lay behind his gravefeatures than on the day they had first seen him.
 Just now he was asmuch absorbed in the chicken fricassee as the boys were.
A full stomach does much toward comforting the harassed human being,and Nickie was no exception to the rule.
 The keen look of defiance cameback into his eyes and he settled back in his chair, quite forgettingfor the time that the man who had so generously fed him, was the manwhom he had expected would kill him.
Skippy's full stomach, while giving him much comfort, did not disarmhim completely.
 He sat back in his chair, noting Nickie's peaceful facebeside him and Devlin's mask-like countenance across the table.
 Someonehad to be ready and on guard--Devlin had a price for everything--evenchicken fricassee.
It came sooner than he expected.
 Devlin was finishing his pie andwashing it down with great draughts of coffee.
 "Well, boys," he said,genially, "I suppose both of you swim, eh?"Skippy kicked Fallon under the table and said, "Nope, not astroke--neither of us.
 Do we, Nick?""Nah.
 Ain't it a shame, hah? We oughta.
 It's something every boy ought to know.
" Devlin got up andhis bulk seemed greater than ever.
 His face had resumed its thoughtfulexpression and the glitter had returned to his eyes.
 "Well, I'll begoing up now--a little business I got to attend to.
 If you boys wash upthe dishes you can have a game of cards before bedtime, eh?"They listened as he walked through the hall and up the stairs.
 Skippywaited until he heard the man's step in his own room before he said,"Well, he's begun workin' on us all right, an' I trumped his ace rightoff the bat.
""How, kid?""He expected us to say we could swim.
""'cause I'm layin' for him all the time from now on.
 Whatever heexpected to do if we'd said yes, I don't know.
 But I know, he's aimin'to try the car trick on us an' he wanted to make sure things wouldn'tgo wrong.
 He can't afford to have us not drown when he's countin' onit, can he?"Nickie put his elbows on the table and cupped his chin.
 "You mean wegotta go through with it an' take the chance that he can't kill us'cause we can swim?""If there ain't any other chance, we gotta.
""Well, I'm licked!" Nickie said hopelessly.
But he wasn't .
CHAPTER XXVA PASSING FACEDistrustful though they were and full of nameless fears, they steppedinto Devlin's coupé early on Monday evening with a feeling of relief.
To be out in the air again, a part of the moving, restless world--itgave them no small thrill and they tried to put out of their minds allthat had troubled them since their strange imprisonment.
Devlin, adept at using either hand, dexterously managed the car withhis left hand and kept his right hand significantly at his pocket.
 "Imight as well warn you boys," he said when they had left the clearing,"that I'll stand for no nonsense.
 I got a silencer on this gun in mypocket and it won't make any noise if either one of you try to beat it.
"Nickie seemed to have been silenced without the gun, but Skippy said,"Aw, don't worry, mister.
 Why should we beat it when you're gonna shipus out west an' everything, huh?""I'm glad you feel that way," the man said gravely, but watching theboys out of the corner of his eye.
 "Timmy got very restless waitingaround and I had an idea he was putting notions in your heads.
"Aw, no," Skippy said with a gulp.
 "I--er--he didn't say nothin'.
"Devlin did not relax.
 "I might as well tell you my plans now," he saidslowly.
 "I'm taking you both to a country doctor not far from here fora physical examination.
 You are to act as if you didn't know where youwere born or much of anything else--understand? You may answer yes andno to any questions he asks you but that is all.
 I'll do the rest ofthe talking.
 And you're my sons--my sons! Don't forget that for amoment.
 I'll be watching every minute.
"They rode through the woods path, turning here and there so that Skippycould not keep track of the route.
 Dusk was rapidly approaching andwhen Devlin slowed down the car as they came abreast of a narrow path,he could just about make it out.
Devlin stopped the car and got out backwards.
 Then, reaching in thepocket flap of the coupé door, he drew out a searchlight and played itup and down the boggy-looking path for a flashing second, yet givingSkippy plenty of time to notice several large footprints on both sidesof the trail.
He said nothing to Nickie for Devlin was back in the car again in amoment and they had started off.
 A few feet farther on they crossed atiny wooden bridge of amateur construction.
"Frost and me fixed that up," said the man as they rattled over thelogs.
 He coughed again.
 "Part bog and part creek and about fifteen feetdeep where we put the logs.
 Folks around here don't knowanything about it any more--their grandfolks and great-grandfolks thatdid have forgot about it now.
"They came at last to a road that had once boasted asphalt and Skippyguessed that it had taken them at least an hour to reach it.
 Along thisthey speeded silently, each one wrapped in his own thoughts.
 Not a cardid they meet, not a person or house did they pass and it was fully twohours after they had left the dismal house when they espied a small,lighted dwelling by the roadside.
Devlin drove past that, too, and presently he turned on to anotherbadly paved road which took them uphill.
 Skippy noticed the darkoutline of mountains spreading out around them.
 It was true then, hethought, the house was situated in the center of swamplands and forest.
But where--where were they?Another half hour's ride and they came into a small village, boasting afew stores and not more than twenty-five houses.
 It was at the extremeend of this quiet community and a little around the bend that Devlinbrought the car to a stop.
"Here we are," he said, backing out as soon as he had turned off hisswitch.
 "Now remember--leave the talking to me!"Skippy felt the gun at his back all the way up the graveled walk.
Nickie kept safely ahead and walked with short, jerky steps.
 They wentup on the porch and a pleasant-faced lady answered the doorbell.
She led them into the sitting room at Devlin's deep-voiced request, andthen disappeared.
 Then the doctor appeared, a short, near-sightedlittle man who talked in nasal accents and put his stethoscope toSkippy's rapidly beating heart with professional alacrity.
"So you got here, eh," he said, as he changed the instrument about onthe boy's chest.
 Smithson told me you'd come.
 Name's Barker, eh?Well, must say you're a sensible man to watch out what's ahead.
 Guessboth boys'll pass muster.
 So you're starting a mushroom place down atDevil's Bog, eh?""Yes, yes," Devlin answered, standing in a nonchalant posture near thedoor.
 "Know much about it, doc?""No, nothing, except that it's full of malaria and mosquitoes and adangerous place to go unless a body knows where they're going," thegarrulous man answered.
 "I've never been there--guess your place isquite a ways in, eh?""Mm," Devlin answered.
 "Beggars can't be choosers, doc.
 I got to do thebest I can for my boys.
 "Guess that's so.
 Sometimes they don't thank a bodyany.
" He had disposed of Skippy by that time and nodded to Nickie.
"Just keep your eye on 'em, that's all you can do.
" Then: "Did you saythey're going to help you?""Mm, I'm too poor to get anyone else.
"And that was all.
 The doctor dismissed them, saying he had to get outon a call and before Skippy could think what to do, they were out onthe porch and the door had closed behind them.
 Nickie looked at hisfriend, desperately.
Skippy sat down on the bottom step and began to untie his shoe.
"Something's hurtin' my foot, mister," he said innocently, as Devlinstood above him, tall and questioning.
 "Guess it's the lining--wait aminute!"Devlin walked a few feet away, standing in an advantageous positionwhile his staring eyes darted from one boy to the other.
 Then,impatiently, he walked on to the car.
 "I'm watching you, kid--hurry!"he said, after curtly ordering Nickie inside.
Skippy got his shoe back on and began to saunter slowly down the walk,when suddenly he saw someone turn in at the path.
 His heart jumped! Itwas a lady and from under her hat the boy could see white hair.
 God hadsent her!"I'm waiting, kid!"Devlin's voice was icy.
 Skippy had to think quickly and, consequently,there was a sharp contact, the lady's pocketbook fell to the ground andits contents fell out on the walk.
Skippy was nothing if not gallant.
 He was on his knees, picking up thescattered articles and cramming them back despite her sweet-voicedprotests.
 But he had to do it quickly, expertly, for Devlin had achallenging look in his cold eyes.
